You can even embed <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/30/feature-plugin-merge-proposal-oembed/">previews of posts</a> from other WordPress sites by pasting the URL on its own line.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There have been a lot of changes for developers to play with as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>REST API (phase 1) </strong>— The underlying infrastructure of the WordPress REST API <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/">plugin</a> has been <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/">included in WordPress 4.4</a>.

If you&#8217;ve already been using a plugin to implement term metadata, you should read <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/22/preparing-your-plugins-and-your-client-sites-for-termmeta/">this post</a> on how to prepare. Also, the underlying <code>WP_Term</code> class improves caching when working with terms. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14162">#14162</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Improved <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> output</strong> — <code>wp_title()</code> is now deprecated; WordPress can <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/20/document-title-in-4-4/">handle the rendering</a> of the document title automatically.</li>\n<li><strong>Comments </strong>— Comment queries are now split for performance.

But hepatitis cases and mortality are still rising sharply : Consider that the number of hepatitis C deaths has quadrupled in the last decade.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Viral hepatitis is one of the most common and deadly infections on the planet, but, for a variety of reasons, the scourge is well down the list of public health and political priorities and, as a result, gets a negligible amount of media coverage.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Why do we hear so little about the scourge of hepatitis ?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a variety of reasons.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">First and foremost, hepatitis kills slowly and silently. The virus can damage the liver over a period of decades before a person has visible signs of cancer or cirrhosis. But the virus can be merciless. About one in five people infected with viral hepatitis will develop cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) that can necessitate a transplant, and 1-5 per cent will die of liver cancer.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the stealth nature of the infection, a large number of sufferers – up to 40 per cent by some estimates – are unaware of their infection. Patterns of infection vary markedly between countries, meaning there is no single global pandemic, but hundreds of overlapping but seemingly unrelated epidemics.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is also a significant disconnect between the cause and the effect of the infection. Few people make the link between getting a blood transfusion as a child, risky sexual behaviour as an experimenting teenager, or one-time needle-sharing, and contracting liver disease later in life.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is also a lot of stigma attached to hepatitis. The chronic fatigue often associated with infection means that sufferers can be pegged as lazy and unproductive.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Because hepatitis viruses can be transmitted sexually and by injection drug use, there are oftentimes negative stereotypes perpetuated about carriers of the disease. Yet, while many cases of hepatitis are preventable, the reality is that the source of infection is often unknown.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The lack of profile of viral hepatitis means few countries undertake systemic screening and data collection is poor which, in turn, creates a vicious cycle of indifference and inaction.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Journalists and other science communicators can help break that cycle by understanding the reality of hepatitis, including the breadth of the problem, and the challenges of prevention and treatment, as well as the opportunities for change on the horizon.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">LIVER DISEASE</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Liver disease is caused by alcohol abuse : That is an ingrained belief around the world. But there are, in fact, a number of causes, the most common of which is hepatitis (hepa is the Greek word for liver ; -itis means inflammation.).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There are several types of hepatitis – A, B, C, D, E, G - all of which have a common origin. The illness hepatitis has been known for centuries – there are reports of epidemic outbreaks of liver disease dating back to 2000 B.C. This long history robs hepatitis of the cache of newness that propels other infectious diseases like AIDS, SARS and MERS into the headlines.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet, hepatitis is, in many ways, a relatively new story. It was not until World War II that scientists realized that hepatitis was caused by viruses and could be blood-borne as well as water-borne. This breakthrough occurred after a large number of soldiers immunized against yellow fever developed hepatitis due to the re-use of needles, not from contaminated water, as was usually the case.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis B was identified in 1963, hepatitis A in 1973 and hepatitis C (long known as non-A-non-B) not until 1989.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">While they share a common name, the viruses are quite different, and even have different routes of transmission. To complicate matters further, there are different genotypes of the viruses in various parts of the world ; there are already seven hepatitis C genotypes that have been identified.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis A is spread through the fecal-oral route, meaning it is generally food-borne and water-borne, but can also be spread by some sexual practices. Hepatitis A also tends to be an acute illness, much like food poisoning, and is deadly only in rare cases.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis B is spread by contact with bodily fluids such as blood, semen and saliva. The virus can be transmitted sexually, during the birth of a child, or by blood transfusion or contact with a contaminated needle.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Because it is spread easily, hepatitis B is the most common form of liver disease. Some people become acutely ill after infection, but most cases are chronic, eventually causing liver cancer or cirrhosis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Globally, hepatitis B kills about 700,000 people annually. This, even though it is vaccine-preventable. The vaccine, which has been available since 1973, is given to babies and, again, before young people become sexually active.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis C is not as easily spread. It is almost exclusively blood-borne, though it is sometimes sexually transmitted.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is, however, quite deadly, also killing about 700,000 people a year. There is no vaccine. There are, however, medications that can cure hepatitis C.<br>\r\nFor all intents and purposes, hepatitis C should be considered principally a healthcare-acquired infection. Most sufferers contract it through exposure to unsafe blood – for example, untested (or inadequately tested) blood used for transfusions, re-used and inadequately sterilized needles and other surgical/medical equipment, and via tattooing and piercing.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">While hepatitis C is often described as a disease of intravenous drug users, only about 10 per cent of the overall number of cases are believed to be caused by shared needles.<br>\r\nIt is important to bear in mind too that much remains to be learned, particularly about hepatitis C. For example, in about 25 per cent of cases, the route of transmission is unknown.</p>\r\n<p>What we do know is that a significant number of people who are infected with viral hepatitis – perhaps as many as one in four – clear the virus on their own and that many others, because the viruses take so long to damage the liver and cause conditions like cancer and cirrhosis, die of other causes. The lengthy period between infection and illness helps create complacency.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">THE GLOBAL PUZZLE</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Globally, 3-5 per cent of the population is infected with viral hepatitis. But the prevalence varies tremendously by region, by country and even within countries.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In Western countries, where immunization against hepatitis B, screening of blood for hepatitis C antibodies, and universal precautions in healthcare settings are the norm, the infection rate is low – less than two per cent.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In many middle- and low income countries, where vaccination may come late or be incomplete, and where healthcare safety norms are not always followed to the letter because of the cost, the infection rate tends to hover around 5-8 per cent.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">And in some parts of Africa and Asia, where the healthcare infrastructure is severely lacking, and unsafe healthcare practices are commonplace, the rate can be as high as 10-15 per cent.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This distribution of cases is a reminder that, like most infectious diseases, the greatest burden of hepatitis is borne by the poorest countries - those that have the fewest resources to undertake prevention programs and to offer adequate care to those who are sick with hepatic disease – and especially by marginalized populations within every country, such as drug users and sex workers.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One has to bear in mind, however, that a lot of the figures cited are guesswork, estimates extrapolated from small samples.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The data are weak because there is little effort and few resources dedicated to collecting it. Few countries conduct universal screening for hepatitis, and many do not even screen pregnant women or those in high risk groups (as is now the norm with HIV) to cut the chain of transmission.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">That leads a number of researchers to believe that despite the shockingly high estimates of the prevalence of viral hepatitis – 350 million carriers of HBV, 185 million HCV and 15 million other chronic carriers – that those numbers may actually be an under-estimate.<br>\r\nFor example, India reports a hepatitis C infection rate of only one per cent, which beggars belief given the crude health infrastructure in large parts of the populous country, not to mention significant levels of injection drug use. Currently, however, there is little incentive for countries to seek out data, as was the case in the early days of the AIDS pandemic. It was only when efforts (and money) were put into research, prevention and treatment that the true extent of HIV infection became clear, but there is no such effort related to viral hepatitis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">What is unquestionable, regardless of the precise numbers, is that they are going in the wrong direction – ever upwards. There is a large and growing gulf between the burden of hepatitis and the awareness and ability to respond to the challenges.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is also clear that, beyond the regional differences, within countries (even those with good screening and treatment) there are some clearly identifiable risk groups that need to be singled out for particular attention.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Intravenous drug users, particularly those who live on the streets or other low-income settings, are the most obvious risk group because there tends to be a fair bit of needle-sharing and high-risk sex work, and harm reduction programs like needle exchanges are not always in place. In some countries, fully half of IV drug users are infected with hepatitis C, and they can also be co-infected with HIV (which has similar means of transmission), acting as carriers of disease.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In some cultures, there are also high-risk practices like tattooing, piercing, scarification, ritual circumcision and female genital mutilation that put people at increased risk of HCV infection. In Pakistan, a study showed that barbers – who use straight razors to shave customers and often nick them – are a major source of the spread of HCV infection.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In some countries with poor health infrastructure, the use of « traditional » healers is also commonplace and they don’t follow safety practices ; neither do merchants who, in public markets, sell concoctions like vitamin and iron shots.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But, again, the greatest risk still comes in the healthcare setting.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">That reality has also left a legacy. A significant number of people get surgery at some point in their lives, and that often involves a transfusion. As a result, in Western countries such as the U.S and Europe, there are a large number of seniors – notably Baby Boomers – who are now being struck by the ravages of hepatitis. Because exposure to blood is so widespread and many received transfusions before testing was implemented, more people die of hepatitis C than AIDS in North America.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Screening of blood for hepatitis B did not begin until the mid-1970s, blood products were not heat-treated to kill viruses like hepatitis until the mid-1980s, and a test for hepatitis C was not developed and implemented until the early-1990s.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The notion that needles and other medical equipment should not be re-used because of the risks of spreading infection is also relatively recent, and disposable « sharps » are still not the norm in many countries.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Practically, that means a lot of people were exposed to potentially contaminated blood – and may only learn of their exposure decades later when they are diagnosed with liver disease in the form of cancer or cirrhosis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A striking example of this is in Egypt, which has one of the highest incidences of hepatitis C in the world with about one in every seven adults infected. In the early 1980s, Egypt set out to deal with the epidemic of schistosomiasis, a common parasitic disease along the Nile River. The treatment, an injection of tartar emetic, was broadly offered, but needles were re-used and not sterilized. The result was to get rid of schistosmiasis, but to infect hundreds of thousands with HCV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis B vaccine has been available since 1982. It is highly effective, but must be given quickly – preferably within 24 hours of birth – if it is going to be effective.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">That is particularly important in parts of the world where there is a high prevalence of HBV, like East Asia, where mother-to-child transmission is a significant risk factor.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The earlier in life someone is infected, the greater the likelihood they will develop liver cancer or cirrhosis. But, in parts of the world where births tend to be at home, and there is not always ready access to healthcare providers who provide services like neonatal vaccination, many children do not get vaccinated adequately, even if they get their childhood hepatitis B shots later on.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no vaccine that protects against hepatitis C, and there is unlikely to be. There are at least six genetically distinct forms (genotypes) of HCV and more than 50 subtypes have been identified, so it is unlikely that a global vaccine could protect against all the variants.<br>\r\nThe genotypes tend to vary by geographic region. Type 1 HCV is most common in the U.S. and Europe ; type 3 dominates in India, the Far East and Australia and ; type 4 is found most frequently in Africa and the Middle East.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The other main reason vaccine development is on the back burner is that there are effective treatments for hepatitis C. In fact, new drugs are so effective they are being called a cure. But, of course, the word « cure » should be used carefully, because there are some provisos notably that the treatment doesn’t always work, and they do not leave people immune to being infected anew.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment for hepatitis C has been around for a long time. Well before the virus was actually identified, severe liver disease was treated with inteferon, and that was, until recently, the standard treatment for patients beginning to feel the effects of chronic infection with viral hepatitis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Interferon, however, is a long, demanding treatment that has a lot of nasty side effects, and works less than half the time.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Interferon boosts the immune system, while the new drugs work by attacking the virus itself ; they keep HCV from replicating and kill off the existing virus in the body.<br>\r\nCure rates are in the neighborhood of 95-97 per cent in well-controlled trials and about 85-90 per cent in the real world – and, as an added bonus, the drugs have far fewer side effects.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There are, to date, two principal products on the market : A combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir (brand name SOVALDI) and a four drug combo - ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir, and dasabuvir (known as <span lang="EN-GB">VIEKIRAX + EXVIERA</span>).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">These drugs have made headlines largely because of the cost – in the U.S. about $1,000 a pill, or up to $95,000 for a full course of treatment. In India, however, the price is as little as $1,000 in total.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But should not forget that the drugs work differently on various genotypes. They are highly effective on HCV 1 genotype (the one that is predominant in North America and Europe) but quite ineffective on HCV type 3 genotype (which we see in India and Africa).</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence_map_1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2559 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence_map_1.jpg" alt="prevalence_map_1" height="445" width="958"></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;Map taken from Messina et al., 2015</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Relative prevalence of each HCV genotype by Global Burden of Disease region.

Thankfully, there are new drugs in the pipeline that will address this problem, though whether they will be affordable is another matter.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The other bit of good news is that, because the new HCV drugs work on different parts of the virus, it is unlikely that resistance will develop, as has been the case with AIDS drugs.<br>\r\nStudies show these new hepatitis drugs are cost-effective at least on an individual basis, because treating the diseases that HCV causes, with liver transplants and cancer treatment, is extremely costly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The larger issue, given the high number of people with hepatitis C, is that the cash outlay to treat everyone would be prohibitive, even if drug costs come down considerably. It is often said that the new treatments will bankrupt drug plans, which is a bit of rhetorical overkill. As with all new expensive drugs, choices will have to be made, and prices should come down over time.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">What it means, practically, is that not everyone infected with HCV will get treated immediately ; there will have to be a prioritization and selection process. Guidelines are already being developed, and they are based on severity of illness, genotype, co-morbidities and drug interactions with treatments for other disease.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Given the effectiveness of these new treatments, there have been moves to step-up screening, which raises a host of practical and ethical issues.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The debate about the cost of treating and curing hepatitis C has focused too narrowly on drugs, which are only a portion of the overall cost.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As with HIV-AIDS drugs, there are discussions about the need to bring down prices, especially in resource-poor settings. Pharmaceutical companies will have an important role to play in these negotiations, and having patent pools and deals with generic makers will likely be solutions.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But having cheaper drugs is only one part of the equation, and the cost.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are going to treat, you first have to test. Screening tests are relatively inexpensive, but genotype testing is not. You also have to test liver function to help determine who is sickest, and to judge effectiveness of the treatment. All of this requires hi-tech laboratories and well-trained personnel. Not to mention a decent healthcare system.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Most important of all is that, even if you cure someone of their HCV infection, their liver disease does not magically disappear. Damage to the organ has occurred over decades, and can still result in liver cancer or cirrhosis, so the promised savings are likely to not be as great as assumed.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Cure is not the same as a vaccine either. People can be re-infected, even after expensive treatment. Given that reality, do you deny treatment to those with high-risk behaviors?<br>\r\nEven the idea of universal screening – and, in many countries, liver disease support groups advocate that all people born prior to 1975 be tested – raises some thorny ethical dilemmas.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If you test everyone do you have an obligation to treat everyone? Is it ethical – and responsible – to tell someone they are infected with a cancer-causing agent and then turn around and say treatment costs are prohibitive so they are ineligible ? If you test, will the infected be stigmatized and discriminated against, for example putting their jobs in peril ?<br>\r\nThese new treatments may be a medical miracle, but they are also a nightmare for policy-makers, especially those whose job it is to contain health budgets.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">THE END GAME</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is not a single country on Earth that is free of hepatitis C. Yet, the promising medical developments that make it possible – at least in theory – to cure most sufferers have some public health advocates dreaming big after years of being relegated to the shadows.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is now open and hopeful talk of hepatitis C « elimination » by 2030. That does not mean eradicating the disease (although that is theoretically possible because there is no insect vector or animal reservoir for HCV). Rather, the ambitious goal is to have 90 per cent of people who are infected with HBV or HCV to be screened and diagnosed, and for 90 per cent of those eligible for treatment have their condition suppressed or cured. This approach mirrors the 90-90-90 strategy for eliminating HIV-AIDS by 2030.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is estimated that meeting those targets would reduce the number of people infected with viral hepatitis by 70 per cent and cut the mortality rate by half within the next generation.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment is only part of the solution. There is not an effective treatment or cure for hepatitis B but there is a vaccine and, after 20 years on the market, it is finally starting to have a significant impact on infection rates.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Because viral hepatitis is principally acquired in the healthcare setting, it is also important to cut infection at the source. Campaigns like Safer Healthcare Now are helping educate and inform the public and health care providers about the importance of hand hygiene, the appropriate use of antibiotics, and monitoring surgical sites to reduce the risk of infections. Public policies that also inadvertently undermine prevention of hepatitis, like the so-called War on Drugs, also have to be abandoned in favor of evidence-based harm reduction initiatives like supervised injection sites, or needle exchanges to decrease the risk of disease spread.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The only way to to rein in the ever-worsening and ever-more deadly epidemic of viral hepatitis is with a concerted global effort, similar to the response to AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria – and it has to be said that the « big three » infectious diseases have a considerable head start. Research is particularly lacking and underfunded; if you want to eliminate a disease, you have to have a solid grasp on how it is transmitted, and on the barriers to prevention and treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Viral hepatitis was long taken for granted, even by global public health agencies like the World Health Organization.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2006, when the Millenium Development Goals were drafted, viral hepatitis was notably absent. It had no champions. At the WHO, an organization with 8,000 employees, there was not a single person with responsibility for hepatitis in their title. Meanwhile there were entire agencies and divisions for AIDS, TB and malaria.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The impetus for change came from the grassroots, from patients. In 2007, hepatitis support groups in a number of countries joined forces to create the World Hepatitis Alliance, and one of their first initiatives was to create World Hepatitis Day, which occurred for the first time on May 19, 2008.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Two years later, the WHO created a global hepatitis program and, in 2014, it published the first guidelines for the screening, care and treatment of HBV and HCV. That same year, the World Health Assembly called on every country to adopt national strategies for dealing with viral hepatitis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The desire – and need – to draft and implement such strategies was given a considerable boost by the arrival of new drugs. The message being driven home by groups like the World Hepatitis Alliance is that countries simply cannot sit on the sidelines anymore; they have to be part of the conversation.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The advent of new treatments, combined with the empowerment of patients, has helped break the silence surrounding this age-old killer.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is now a rare opportunity to significantly prevent and treat millions of cases of cancer and other deadly liver diseases. There is, in essence, a solution – or, more accurately, solutions – to a millenium old problem.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is also a story – no, stories – to be told. But those stories need to be factual, nuanced and evidence-informed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'The disease', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'the-disease', '', '', '2015-10-11 21:47:01', '2015-10-11 21:47:01', '', 0, 'http://localhost/~mpierre1/projects/clients/WFSJ/?page_id=18', 0, 'page', '', 0),

It was a manufactured version of interferons, proteins naturally produced in the body that enhance the immune system’s response to viral infection. <strong>Interferon-alfa (IFN-α)</strong> treatment required subcutaneous injections three to five times per week.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2001, two modified forms of interferon were introduced (PEGylated interferons: PegIFN-α2a and PegIFN-α2b). These modified interferons circulated in the body for a longer period of time before being cleared by the kidneys, so injections were only needed once a week.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A drug combination that included <strong>PEGylated interferon-α</strong> later became the standard of care for hepatitis C. <strong>Ribavirin</strong> was administered with <strong>PEGylated interferon-α</strong> to enhance its effects, but despite this improvement, still less than half of patients benefitted from treatment. Genotype 1, the most common strain of Hepatitis C in higher income countries, was particularly unresponsive to these drugs. The treatment regimen required ingestion of several capsules of ribavirin per day and one injection per week of PEGylated interferon for 48 weeks. Many people abandoned therapy prematurely because of intolerable side effects such as flu-like symptoms, including fever and weakness. Anemia was also common and often severe. Some patients reported that their treatment had a significant impact on mood, leading to feelings of depression (See<strong> Figure 1</strong>).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">These treatments improved the patient’s natural response against HCV, but did not target the virus itself. Efficacy was low, while side effects were significant.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A cure against HCV genotype 1, the most common strain of HCV in high income countries, remained elusive. Drug companies saw a large and potentially profitable market so they steered funds and resources towards this branch of research. Publicly funded research was also aggressively investigating viral hepatitis C during this period.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">These efforts led to the development of a new class of drugs – the direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). This class of drug does not affect the patient’s immune system, but attacks the virus itself, blocking one or more steps of its life-cycle. The precise mechanism of the different DAAs will be explored in s<strong>ection 2</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2011, the protease inhibitors were the first DAAs to be introduced, named for their ability to inhibit viral protein synthesis. <strong>Boceprevir</strong> and <strong>telaprevir</strong>, both given orally in combination with PEGylated interferon-α and ribavirin, improved cure rates (the percentage of people cured)― up to 75% for genotype 1, but they also produced additional side effects to those already present with previous treatments and increased the overall burden of side effects proportionately (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Another research breakthrough led to the development of new HCV DAAs that could inhibit viral replication. Their first passage from clinical trials to the real world was a disappointment, however; despite good results in initial trials, these treatments proved to be less effective and more toxic (even fatal) when used in the field.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The turning point was in 2014. A new class of direct acting antivirals (DAA) was released on the market. <strong>Sofosbuvir</strong> was very effective on genotype 1 and produced successful results in a great majority of patients. Administered in combination with PEGylated interferon and ribavirin, Sofosbuvir tablets produced a cure rate of over 90 % of patients with hepatitis C genotype 1, 2, 3 and 4. In addition, the new treatment was much shorter (usually 12-24 weeks), simple to take, and very well tolerated.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In the months that followed, other DAA drugs and DAA drug <strong>combinations</strong> with comparable dramatic success rates were approved (see table 1). Indeed, it had become clear that by combining more than one drug, each acting on a different aspect of the virus life cycle, the highly mutable Hepatitis C virus could be stopped, and its resistance to treatment prevented (see <strong>section 2</strong> for a discussion on <em>how drug combinations successfully provide a high barrier to resistance</em>).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Another advancement between late 2014 and early 2015, was the discovery that interferon-free regimens (sometimes even without ribavirin) can be equally effective, showing that it may be possible to circumvent the worst treatment side effects that continued to hinder treatment and compliance in some patients.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Figure-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2460 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Figure-1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" height="487" width="828"></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAware-BOX-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2462 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAware-BOX-1.jpg" alt="BeAware BOX 1" height="1047" width="1992"></a>The development of the new DAA drugs caused a major shift in the hepatitis C treatment landscape –they could be used to treat every patient with the disease. However getting access to them would prove difficult. Their prohibitive price has meant that they are beyond the reach of a majority of patients, especially in low and middle income countries.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All over the world, patient associations, doctors and health authorities are advocating for industries to drop these prices in order to treat as many patients as possible, as was done for HIV/AIDS drugs.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This has shifted the focus of the hepatitis C problem from a medical issue to one of public policy. Political, economic, and ethical issues surrounding access to care and who pays the costs of medical research, drug development and marketing, are at the forefront of this rapidly evolving health issue.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/50w8LdjdYIo?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe><br>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-11.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2461 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-11.jpg" alt="Table 1" height="2988" width="2039"></a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cjszp5h6Q04?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul style="font-size: 15px; color: black;">\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;According to their mechanism of action, the new DAAs drugs can be classified into 4 classes:<br>\r\n1. the first class, <strong>NS3-4A protease inhibitors</strong>, block the production of <strong>viral proteins</strong> (i.e. simeprevir, paritaprevir)</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">All the other three classes block the production of <strong>viral genes</strong> (RNA).<br>\r\nThese include:<br>\r\n2. <strong>Nucleotide analogues</strong> that inhibit the enzyme (NS5B polymerase) needed for viral replication (i.e. sofosbuvir);<br>\r\n3.<strong> Non-nucleotide analogues</strong> that inhibit the same enzyme (NS5B polymerase) needed for viral replication but with a different mechanism (i.e. dasabuvir);<br>\r\n4. <strong>NS5A inhibitors</strong> block both the replication and the assembly of the virus (i.e. ledipasvir, daclatasvir, ombitasvir,..)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As of July 2015, the approved treatments available for treating Hep C are summarized in the following table:</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2b_revised_smaller.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2725 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2b_revised_smaller.jpg" alt="Table 2b_revised_smaller" height="1061" width="1198"></a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAwareBOX-2.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2469 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAwareBOX-2.jpg" alt="BeAwareBOX 2" height="336" width="1192"></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Many other new molecules and combinations are currently under investigation in order to simplify the treatment and tackle the few patients resistant to the current available drugs.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><a name="sec2"></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">2) <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">How is the efficacy of anti HCV drugs measured? Is the currently used outcome reliable?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The best way to assess the efficacy of anti HCV drugs as well as of any other treatment would be through well designed randomized, placebo controlled trials - possibly independent from industry - that would measure the effect of drugs on the progression of liver disease and on the risk of illness/morbidity and mortality. These would prove that the new drugs not only cure infection, but can prevent more advanced liver disease and deaths that happen decades later in people with chronic infection.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However disease progression of chronic hepatitis C is very slow. Conditions like cirrhosis and liver cancer take decades to develop and these clinical outcomes must be measured 20-30 years after the <strong>time</strong> of treatment. These types of trials would be very costly. Furthermore, a relatively small proportion of patients develop a severe disease (15-30% of patients with chronic hepatitis develop <strong>cirrhosis</strong> and 3-17% of patients with cirrhosis develop<strong> liver cancer</strong>), so <strong>large numbers</strong> of participants would need to be included in these trials to reach statistical significance. There are also ethical considerations, regarding the use of a placebo control group in this case!</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A surrogate outcome is therefore used in these situations. This is a measure that does not directly assess the important outcome (ie.: reducing severe liver disease and death), but is believed to reflect the important outcome. The measure used here is the continued absence of hepatitis C virus in blood for 6 months which is referred to as a sustained virologic response (SVR)).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The reliability of this outcome has been questioned by some experts because it is not clear whether the virus might “hide” in certain cellular compartments and body tissues while the bloodstream is clear of virus. Several studies conducted in the past with older therapies showed however that a sustained response usually corresponds to 1) a lack of virus in other body tissues -indeed, the idea that the virus could hide in so called “sanctuaries”, i.e. other tissues, as HIV does, has never been proven and 2) less liver related illness/morbidity and mortality compared with people without a sustained response</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a name="sec3"></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">3) <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">How effective are the new HCV drugs in clinical trials and in the real world?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Indeed, recent clinical trials on the new drugs for HCV, the DAAs, are reporting 85-100% cure rates across genotypes, with the precise level of effectiveness depending on the genotype and drug combination. However, it is important to note that these drugs are still under investigation, and we do not yet have much data on what the results will be in the field– Real life is always messier in terms of treatment safety and efficacy. Below are the issues that must be considered when interpreting clinical trial results.</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAwareBOX-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2486" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAwareBOX-3-1024x672.jpg" alt="BeAwareBOX 3" height="590" width="900"></a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;The 5-15% matter:</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, even a small percentage, such as the 5-15% of patients that will not respond to treatment or experience a relapse, can represent a very large absolute number of patients that could fail treatment when it comes to treating millions of people all over the world.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If we anticipate that 10 per cent of patients will not experience success with the new drugs, then 15 million people in the world will not be cured with treatment. So we can say that the great majority of patients today in theory could be cured, but not all of them. Issues with resistance will also arise in this patient population, because treatment failure will represent selection of drug-resistant viruses, and alternate second-line treatment choices will be limited.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-3_revisedFINAL_smaller.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2745 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-3_revisedFINAL_smaller.jpg" alt="Table 3_revisedFINAL_smaller" height="965" width="604"></a></p>\r\n<p align="center">&nbsp;<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ywQQ9zfpbDY?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a name="sec4"></a></p>\r\n<p>4) <strong><a name="sec4"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What drives the choice of treatment?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The choice of treatment for chronic hepatitis C is driven by many factors linked to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">the<strong> virus genotype</strong> (and sometimes subtype)</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">the <strong>stage of liver disease</strong> (especially the presence of cirrhosis)</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">patient’s <strong>clinical history</strong> (such as being treated before/having undergone a treatment failure)</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">The patient’s <strong>genetic characteristics</strong> (for example which ethnic group they are part of) can have an impact on the efficacy of older drugs. A variant of gene <strong>IL28B</strong> – a gene involved in the immune response to HCV. There are three IL28B subtypes – CC, CT, TT. If a person has the CC variant of the gene, the individual is not only more likely to clear the virus without treatment during the acute phase, if a chronic infection does develop it is 3 times likely that PegIFN and Ribavirin will cure infection.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, the presence of a<strong> Q80K</strong> genetic variant that develops in certain strains of HCV makes the virus less susceptible to simeprevir.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Possible co-infections</strong> (i.e. with Hepatitis BVirus and/or HIV) do not influence therapeutic approaches with the new drugs, but still need to be considered in all those settings where the latest treatments are not available.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, the most relevant, often critical, factor in the choice of treatment in most parts of the world is currently the <strong>access to the new drugs.</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This issue will be dealt with in a following section.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL 2015), as well as the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) rely on <strong>clinical aspects</strong> to formulate treatment recommendations. These recommendations identify the best approved treatment options (either in Europe or in the USA) for each patient based on current scientific evidence.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">On this basis, without considering economic issues, the EASL 2015 guidelines recommend interferon-free regimens as the best option, when available, in all HCV infected patients because of their effectiveness, ease of use, and tolerability.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Where new drugs are not available, either PegIFNα+ ribavirin or triple combination with telaprevir or boceprevir (protease inhibitors) remain acceptable in selected patients likely to respond, at least until new drugs become available and affordable.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The choice of treatment is mainly based on HCV genotype, HCV subtype and viral load. Also to be considered is whether the patient has cirrhosis, or has been treated previously with other drugs.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Different options, unless otherwise indicated, are equally effective, so that doctors can choose what is best and economically feasible for each patient, according to the reimbursement conditions in their own country.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dEtaTAzfWKg?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>THE CHOICE OF TREATMENT ACCORDING TO EASL 2015</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-4B-copy.gif"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2492 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-4B-copy.gif" alt="Table 4B copy" height="5368" width="2790"></a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><a name="sec5"></a></p>\r\n<p><strong>5) <span style="color: #3366ff;">Could widespread use of the new drugs lead to emergence of resistant strains?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the hepatitis C virus can change or mutate, some strains naturally acquire genetic characteristics that make them resistant to one treatment or another. When an antiviral drug is given, it blocks replication in all sensitive viruses. Those viruses that are resistant are able to proliferate in that patient. The patient does not respond to treatment anymore and the disease grows. To avoid this, a combination of drugs that affect different aspects of HCV viral replication have always been given together, for a duration that is sufficient to eliminate the infection.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite this, some patients still become resistant to treatment and other options have to be found. The best strategy for these cases is still under investigation.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c_vxvCY1_qc?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">6<a name="sec6"></a><strong>)<span style="color: #3366ff;"> Do new drugs have side effects?</span></strong><br>\r\nThe new drugs against hepatitis C, the so-called “second-generation DAAs”, are very well tolerated by patients and cause <strong>fewer, and much less severe, side effects</strong> than the previous treatments. Patients who were previously treated with earlier generations of medications report a significant difference.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, it cannot be said that this issue has been completely overcome. Many regimens still require<strong> interferons and/or ribavirin</strong> because of the characteristics of the virus and the stage of liver disease. The side effects of these drugs (anemia, low white cell count, headache, fatigue, skin rashes and so on) must be considered by all the patients for whom interferon and ribavirin-free treatment <strong>cannot be prescribed</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The risk of adverse events may always be considered an acceptable alternative to liver failure or cancer in patients with advanced liver disease. However for those without concurrent liver disease the risks associated with treatment may be less acceptable, as only a fraction of them will go on to develop serious consequences.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, safety data on new treatments are still limited, since <strong>post-marketing surveillance</strong> (i.e. the recording of any registered side effect when a drug is on the shelves) for most of these drugs has just begun. Post-marketing surveillance is always important, but even more so for new drugs such as these, which were approved very rapidly because of their ability to cure infection and save lives.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In the clinical trials, the rate of serious adverse events (resulting in persistent disability, hospital admission, or death) was very low (0,5-3%) . Such a<strong> small percentage</strong>, could still represent a significant<strong> absolute number</strong> of cases if millions of people are treated. Of the estimated 150 million people in world who are infected chronic HCV, this percentage of adverse events would represent 750, 000 to 4.5 million people affected.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treating hundreds of thousands people could also reveal <strong>rare side effects</strong> unlikely to be detected in trials with fewer participants.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the safety profile of these drugs needs to be evaluated in <strong>unselected patients</strong>, who can have other concurrent diseases, genetic characteristics, be of different ages and ethnic groups.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The main cause for concern at the moment is the risk of <strong>drug interactions</strong>. This kind of side effect can more easily emerge when treatment is given in the real world, where patients can have other diseases for which they take medications not considered during clinical trials.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">An example of this is the recent FDA advisory about <strong>amiodarone</strong>, a drug used to treat the irregular beating of the heart (arrhythmias). When taken with simeprevir and other antivirals, severe (even fatal) bradycardia has been reported prompting the US FDA to published an alert against the concomitant use of these two medications.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uUuTnWO0PWU?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><a name="sec7"></a></p>\r\n<p><strong>7) <span style="color: #3366ff;">Does co-infection with HIV change the management of hepatitis C?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a significant amount of stigma associated with HIV and HCV. Both are infectious diseases which in and of itself is sufficient to lead to stigma and discrimination, especially if the diseases and their methods of transmission are not well understood by the general public. Further, in certain countries the incidence of these viruses is highest among intravenous drug users.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Co-infection with HIV does not have an impact on the success rate of the new direct antivirals. However co-infected patients still require more attention because they have a higher risk of drug-drug interactions and their impaired immune systems could let the disease progress more quickly and aggressively.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>8<a name="sec8"></a><strong>) <span style="color: #3366ff;">Who determines dosage?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Optimal dosage and length of anti HCV treatments have been established in clinical trials. The recommended dosage is a set parameter, not to be changed. However, the degree of “aggressiveness” of a drug therapy can be changed by altering: 1) the number of drugs in the combination and 2) the length of treatment. “Overtreatment” may be advisable in real life settings for patients who are more difficult to cure. However, under-treatment without supporting evidence could lead to the emergence of dangerous resistant strains.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gNugNchJGUg?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><strong><a name="sec9"></a>9) <span style="color: #3366ff;">Who should be tested?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the vast majority of people are unaware of their condition because they are asymptomatic or experiencing symptoms too generic to arouse suspicion, patients must first be identified before addressing treatment issues. This can be done by <strong>screening</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There are controversial <strong>policy issues</strong> surrounding the ethics of screening, particularly if a country does not have the resources to treat the number of individuals that are expected to be identified. This is discussed at length in the<em> public policy module</em>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some countries recommend screening people with risk factors such as current or previous injection drug users or those who received blood transfusions prior to implementing safe screening strategies. Other countries recommend screening high risk groups, such as those born between 1945-1965 ― a generation that was more exposed to infection before the virus was identified.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As the risk of being infected is higher in these groups, the probability of finding patients with asymptomatic liver disease who would benefit from treatment is higher as well.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Encouraging everybody to get tested, would increase the number of infected people identified. Many of these individuals may have been well for decades (and maybe would have died of other causes before even knowing they were infected by HCV), but they are now suddenly told that they have a disease. Since transmission of HCV is not so easy in everyday life, and common hygienic habits are enough to avoid it, this revelation is unlikely to improve prevention measures markedly. However studies show that people diagnosed with HCV express relief in knowing about their disease as they feel more in control of avoiding infecting those they love. In addition, individuals who become aware of their infection can take measures to help limit further damage to their liver. There are many life style changes that an infected patient can adopt, such as no longer consuming alcohol.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h4KyRlpLhSk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>Add Charles gore video 13 in the policy section--------------------------------------</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a name="sec10"></a>10)<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"> Who should be treated?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that effective and tolerable treatments are available, many patients’ associations, doctors and experts worldwide feel that <strong>all the people infected with HCV</strong> should be treated, irrespective of the state of their liver or of the cost of treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">From a clinical point of view, the goal of treatment is to cure HCV patients of infection to prevent hepatic cirrhosis, or halt cirrhosis before the liver is too damaged to function, known as decompensated cirrhosis. Other long terms effects include liver cancer, and even severe health issues in other parts of the body – including autoimmune conditions and nephropathies, and death.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, the cure reduces the risk of decompensation and cancer. When a patient already has decompensated cirrhosis, the treatment can reduce the need for a liver transplantation. However, it should be noted that the impact on middle-to long term survival in these patients is still unknown.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the 2015 EASL guidelines, <strong>all patients with chronic liver disease</strong> due to HCV should be considered for treatment, with priorities associated to the severity of their condition.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment with an interferon-free regimen is urgent in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and should be prioritized in patients with significant fibrosis or cirrhosis, i.e. with F3 to F4 score on the METAVIR scale of liver disease severity.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In patients with no damage or mild disease the treatment can be either deferred or considered in particular cases of severity (HBV or HIV coinfection, significant extra-hepatic manifestations, debilitating fatigue) or when the risk of transmitting HCV to others is high.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Indications for treatment of chronic hepatitis C in 2015: Who should be treated and when?</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-5.gif"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2493 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-5.gif" alt="Table 5" height="1939" width="4077"></a></p>\r\n<p>Modified from EASL Recommendations on Treatment of Hepatitis C 2015</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qnSKUC7IPU4?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><a name="sec10"></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">10) <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Is eradication of hepatitis C the actual goal?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the availability of very effective treatments, complete<strong> eradication</strong> of hepatitis C from the world is not a realistic goal without a vaccine. A much more realistic goal is <strong>control</strong> of the disease, which can be achieved at least in high income countries, through prevention, diagnosis, a good healthcare system and access to drugs.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l4hdxRzmvDs?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><a name="sec11"></a>11.<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"> How much do these new drugs cost?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Negotiations between countries and pharmaceutical companies vary from one country to another. As a result, their price is different from drug to drug and from country to country.<br>\r\nIn the US, when sofosbuvir was introduced, each pill cost about 1000 dollars US, for a total price of 80.000-90.000 dollars for a cycle of 12 weeks.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In Europe different health systems have negotiated different prices, in some circumstances up to half the US price. In Italy, for example, a price/volume system of payment has been established, with the cost of drugs going down the more patients are treated.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In low income countries firms have agreed on a cheaper price. In Egypt a whole cycle of sofosbuvir costs about 500 US dollars. In India, Gilead (the company that owns sofosbuvir) has allowed 11 generic firms to produce the drug at low prices and sell it to about 90 developing countries, with a list of clauses to avoid illicit marketing towards middle and high-income countries.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zge-TvYFc9g?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>12)<a name="sec12"></a> <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">How is (and could) Hepatitis C be treated and managed in low and middle resources countries?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The challenge of Hepatitis C in low and middle income countries is not only about the price of drugs. There are other hurdles to face, such as traditional habits that hinder prevention and facilitate the transmission of the disease, the cost and difficulties of screening and the lack of medical resources. Hepatologists, for example, are very rare in Africa, but infectious disease specialists knowledgeable in liver diseases could be recruited. The network of institutions, facilities and staff built up to address HIV in many low and middle income countries could be now exploited to deal with HCV as well.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When an effective treatment to control AIDS was developed, it seemed costs would be prohibitive for low income countries. Instead, today, thanks to the efforts of governments, industry and non- governmental organizations, most patients who are diagnosed in the world can have access to treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The same result can hopefully be achieved for hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bSaLvzqsRmU?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">REFERENCES</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Ghany MG, Strader DB, Thomas DL, Seeff LB; American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.

Doctors have known about HCV – or, as it was long known, non-A non-B hepatitis - for years, but it was believed to be less problematic than its better known viral cousins, hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Besides, there were other, more formidable, infectious disease challenges that came along, like AIDS, that pre-occupied public health officials and politicians. But quietly, over time, scientific knowledge of hepatitis C grew and, along with it, the sobering realization that it is one of the world’s biggest killers, claiming as many lives as hepatitis B, and even more than malaria.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But, unlike other forms of viral hepatitis, there are effective treatments for HCV, and that means many of the estimated 700,000 deaths the disease claims annually are preventable – at least in theory. These treatments come at a high price and good data are lacking on how many are truly infected on a global scale, and who would benefit most from treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Medicine, however, is only part of the story. HCV is a political and public health challenge on a global scale and, to come to grips with it, we must address many questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">How HCV has become a public health crisis.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">What is the best public health response to the epidemic?</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Who should be screened, and how?</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">The challenges around treatment beyond cost.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThis section will focus on these issues and more, providing fodder for inquisitive journalists.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a name="sec2"></a>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2.<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"> The Unseen Epidemic: events behind the HCV crisis</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The role of public health is to protect and improve the health of the population, not just individuals. Prevention and health promotion initiatives help routine challenges, such as the spread of infectious diseases, from developing into crises. However, public health officials rarely have the final say on priority-setting, adoption of specific strategies, or how much money will be allocated to the response. That belongs to politicians, and they may accept, ignore, or even go against expert advice, for a host of economic or political reasons.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">How to respond to hepatitis C proved to be a major challenge for public health experts and policy-makers. At first, they had little solid information to guide their response. While scientists had known since the mid-70s that there was a variant of hepatitis that was neither A nor B, they could not pinpoint it. There was no test to detect it and no vaccine to prevent it. They also assumed, quite reasonably that the virus was not that big of a deal because few people fell acutely ill. They would realize only later that the virus gnawed away slowly at the liver and caused grave conditions like liver cancer and cirrhosis decades later.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV was finally given a proper name in 1989, when the virus was discovered. Soon after, an antibody test was developed to screen blood for the virus, and public health officials and regulators began the process of creating blood screening strategies. It was believed that this would help contain the spread of the virus. However, at the time, whether this was necessary was a matter of debate. HCV was seen as a small-scale problem, causing only minor manifestations in relatively few patients, many of whom were believed to clear the infection after the initial symptoms. No one knew HCV caused chronic infections or that carriers of the virus were able to infect others even when they had no obvious signs of illness.</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZouPfK_E2j0?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As the global impact of HCV has become apparent, the World Health Assembly - WHO’s governing body - has adopted a number of resolutions. In 2011, July 28 was officially recognized as World Hepatitis Day - to create awareness, strengthen prevention and coordinate a global response. A Global Hepatitis Program has also been set up within the WHO to set standards and issue guidelines to help countries formulate specific hepatitis policies for prevention and treatment.</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-lyEJQYBnDM?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHepatitis C had little profile as a public health issue because was it was thought to be a problem mainly confined to intravenous drug users.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ywPfw-vhEM?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> As screening increased, it was discovered that out of the approximately 150 million individuals living with chronic hepatitis C only some 10 million got it through injection drug use. The vast majority contracted the virus via contact with the health system, through blood transfusions, unsafe injections and other health care exposures with poor infection control practices.</p>\r\n <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4i2tHXkX_lE?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\nAnother factor contributing to the crisis might possibly be doctors themselves.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qT_B_pb0XTo?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a name="sec3"></a>\r\n<h2> <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">3.</span> P for Public Health: Protection - Prevention - Promotion - Prognosis - Provision</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The role of public health</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Public Health tools for handling HCV could include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li><strong>Surveillance and patient screening</strong>:\r\nmonitoring national prevalence (number of total cases) and incidence (number of new cases in a given period of time) of the virus, identifying asymptomatic chronic carriers, following these patients to determine when to provide treatment and making sure they adhere to the prescribed regimen</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Education:</strong>\r\ndisseminating information to the public and health professionals about the disease, risk factors, how to avoid infection, etc. on a regular basis and with a special effort on national and community level to mark World Hepatitis Day on July 28\r\ninitiating health education and training to reduce risk of transmission during exposures in nonmedical (e.g., commercial barbering, body piercing, tattoos, and traditional circumcision) and occupational (e.g., health care and sanitation worker) settings.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Testing Blood products</strong>:\r\ntesting all blood used for transfusions and blood products\r\nvirus inactivation (heat-treatment) of plasma-derived products\r\nencouraging the use of as little transfusion blood as possible</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Infection-Control</strong>:\r\nenforcing infection control practices\r\nencouraging the use of therapeutic syringes with features to prevent reuse and injuries as well as safe handling and disposal of sharps and waste\r\nencouraging adequate sterilization of reusable material such as surgical or dental instruments</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Counseling:</strong>\r\npeople with chronic, asymptomatic HCV\r\nincluding teaching them not to share toothbrushes and razors with others and to let their dentist and other medical workers know of their infection status, giving these individuals the opportunity to protect themselves appropriately</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Harm Reduction</strong>:\r\ninitiating harm reduction programs, with counseling, needle-syringe exchange and opiate substitution therapy for injection drug users</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However resources are limited, and as a result, political prioritization guides public health decisions. Public health may make recommendations, but whether or not these recommendations will be acted upon is something that will be determined at the political level. Therefore it is important to understand that there is public health and there are politics and these are not always aligned.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>This is also fertile ground for journalism</em>: to document and explore the discrepancies between promises and action.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventing the spread of HCV does not require reinventing the wheel. Many of these strategies are already used to prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS: the screening of donor blood and blood products, universal infection control practices, education, and harm reduction. A number of the steps that have been used against HIV/AIDS likely helped curb the spread of HCV because they have similar routes of transmission and there is some co-infection.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, HCV can stay active outside the human body much longer than HIV. Consequently, infection control practices (e.g., hand-washing, sterilization of reusable medical equipment, and cleaning of surfaces) have to be even stricter for HCV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All the HIV/AIDS prevention efforts never managed to curtail one significant contributor to the spread of blood-borne infections in low- and middle-income countries: unnecessary injections. In Egypt, where there is a generalized HCV epidemic, the prevalence is highest in people with ongoing or a past history of medical injections. It will require determined education efforts to change the practice of re-using needles for vaccinations and other procedures.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, what is needed most fundamentally to prevent the spread of infectious diseases like hepatitis C is a well-functioning and well-staffed healthcare system – something that does not exist in many countries - along with political will, a willingness to invest in safer healthcare.</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YV2zVQC5-z0?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Many countries have only applied a few of the public health tools against HCV. Is that an option?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As most chronic patients are asymptomatic it might seem easy to ignore the disease, but there can be serious impacts on a community or a country’s health care resources. If a large group of individuals begins to exhibit liver disease within the same time frame, as expected in this case, then governments will indeed be faced with an acute problem. What course of action politicians decide to take determines the outcome of this public health issue.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of instituting sound health policies can slow their adoption. For example, when a blood test for HCV became available in the early 1990s, some countries were slow to incorporate it as part of the regular screening of blood in hospitals as they had already spent a considerable amount in the 1980s to set up screening for HIV/AIDS.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Even before HCV was identified in 1989 it was known that a non-A, non-B hepatitis was circulating in the blood supply. It is estimated that in the 1970s in the U.S., the risk of contracting hepatitis from blood-transfusion was as high as 30 per cent. Thanks to screening of donor blood, that risk dropped to almost zero by the year 2000.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WsB0L7KqU18?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Questions worth asking:</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Overuse of (unnecessary) injections with unsterile equipment seems to be a driver in spreading the virus, seen not only in Egypt, but in many low- and middle-income countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Can education counter the popular belief that injections works against most everything?</em></li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to make sure that the needle being used in a medical procedure was sterile?</em></li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to make sure that the needle being used for an injection in a market stall was sterile?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A key question that was asked in country after country with regard to tainted blood and HIV/AIDS could also be applied to HCV:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Did public health do enough and in time to curb the spread of non-A, non-B hepatitis? Or did they opt to do nothing to save money?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a name="sec4"></a>\r\n<h2> 4. <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">The unknowingly infected</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Screening Strategies: How to find those who are infected and do not know it?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>A large number of people infected with HCV are ‛silent carriers‛ - meaning they show no symptoms for years, even decades. How can they be identified? And should they be identified if the resources </em><em>treat them are lacking</em><em>? </em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Universal screening – testing everyone systematically for HCV – is one approach, at least in theory. But, in most countries that is not practical, nor fiscally responsible, given all the other health priorities. Besides, a screening test only confirms past exposure to the virus. That would need to be followed up with other more costly tests that 1) confirm the continued presence of the virus circulating in the blood, and in what amounts, and 2) determine the degree damage to the liver. It is a cascade of testing that can quickly become very costly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ideally, what researchers would like to see is a single, inexpensive blood or serology test that provides all the relevant information. But a test like that is currently only a dream.</p>\r\n<em>If you rule out universal screening, you then move to selective screening of high-risk groups. But who do you target first?</em>\r\n\r\nIn the U.S. and Canada, systematic screening of all Baby Boomers is recommended – specifically everyone born between 1945 and 1965 in the U.S. and 1945 to 1975 in Canada.\r\n\r\nThis demographic group is singled out because they are at significant risk of having been exposed to tainted blood through a transfusion, through the sharing of needles and unprotected sex. Because HCV infection often takes decades to have serious health impacts – like cirrhosis and liver cancer – this group is also most likely to suffer health impacts.\r\n\r\nInjection drug users and prisoners are also obvious targets for screening, as are blood donors who are rejected because they have one or more risk factors. But it cannot be forgotten that a significant proportion of HCV carriers – as many as one in four – have no obvious risk factors. Many countries are also adding hepatitis C to the current panel of screening tests done on pregnant women, in the hope they can prevent the virus from being passed on from mother-to-child.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7sKLcICED7Q?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It should be noted, however, that a number of countries, such as the Scandinavian nations, have made a decision to not screen for hepatitis C. Their reasoning is that the incidence of HCV - the number of new cases - has been close to zero for the past 20 years and that the rare cases found are usually imported, i.e. they would not be found by screening residents of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Testing is fraught with ethical questions.</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on present knowledge, roughly 70 per cent of those infected will probably not develop serious complications as a result of their infection. However, the test in itself cannot determine whether a patient will be among the 30 per cent who will develop a life-threatening liver disease. In addition, it is not known whether the 70/30 division will hold up over the long term. Only time will tell.</p>\r\nCurrent treatment protocols call for offering treatment first to patients showing the effects of chronic HCV infection, because it is believed they are most likely to develop cirrhosis or liver cancer. But how do you reassure the other 70 per cent, the people who know they are infected but have no obvious illness? Will they be satisfied with simply being monitored, knowing they too could fall ill down the road?\r\n\r\n<span style="color: #000000;">The key ethical question is whether you should actually test broadly if the resources do not exist to treat and care for everyone who has been identified as a carrier.</span>\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DmRaC6BsURc?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But it could also be argued that even if there is no promise of treatment, it would still be valuable to know whether you are infected. Because of the preventive steps you can take, like drinking less alcohol, and reducing the stress on the liver. Or being careful not to infect others (e.g., not sharing toothbrushes or razors with others, informing dentists and health care workers of infection status).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If treatment is unavailable, should people be informed that they are infected with a virus that could potentially cause cancer? Is it unethical to withhold that information?</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3QAP8fdq5X4?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Once identified, what next?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis C is a resource-intensive disease that many health systems will find hard to manage. A strong health system is required, and the ever-growing case load can potentially overwhelm even well-endowed systems.</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_s6bDMbzmQ?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\nOne way low- and middle income countries have dealt with the crush burden of HIV/AIDS, has been to establish a parallel health system, caring only for patient with that condition. Could that approach, called “vertical programs,” also work for hepatitis C? And does this offering of specialized care strengthen or weaken the overall health system? The experience that countries in West Africa lived with the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak is that this approach may be counter-productive, leaving the rest of the system weak and vulnerable to new challenges. Ideally, investing in programs to treat diseases like HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C should be done in a manner that bolsters the system overall.\r\n\r\nThe countries that do have a hepatitis policy usually have well-functioning health systems in place to build on, to integrate hepatitis into what already exists.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B1T4XcjX24c?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to note, however, that the expertise that has been built up in the HIV/AIDS programs could also be used to manage viral hepatitis, especially given the fact that the burden of HIV/AIDS is falling, and that of HCV is growing.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Do countries need a specific hepatitis policy?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It depends, as often is the case, on the local settings.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If the health system has the capacity and the resources to treat and follow a patient with chronic hepatitis like they would treat and follow up any other patient, then probably not.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If the health system does not have that capacity, then a plan, based on know-how from WHO‛s Global Hepatitis Program may be a good idea, because it will tell what to do and in which order. Also it can be a tool for accountability, to make sure things are being done.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The accumulated case load is again the obstacle. Dealing with a crisis usually comes at a cost, financial and managerial, somewhere else in the system. Most, maybe all, health systems don’t run with funds and personnel to spare. Budgets and resources are limited, even in the strongest, most developed and well-resourced health systems. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa, so overwhelmed Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, that even with foreign assistance, other serious health problems could not be addressed; maternal health, malaria, vaccinations, as well as many emergency rooms were severely affected. Even high income countries may run into problems caused by a surge in need for a particular treatment or test. After beginning to offer screening for colorectal cancers to all persons between the ages of 50-74 years, the healthcare system in Denmark witnessed an unexpected increase in waiting lists―so many more patients than anticipated needed follow-up colonoscopies that a number of hospital units could not keep up, despite having had years to prepare for the roll out of the screening program.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Other questions to ask:</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Doctors decide, based on guidelines, which patients receive treatment first.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How are patients told they are not yet eligible for treatment? How do ineligible patients feel?</em></li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>What do you do as a journalist when approached by an ineligible patient? Do you write their story, trying to make the doctor change his or her mind?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Current protocols for treating HIV-positive individuals recommend initiation of triple therapy as soon as infection is confirmed and not waiting several years for the immune system to be compromised.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Why then do HCV-positive individuals have to wait?</em></li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>The same question could be asked for statins that are readily given to prevent heart attacks and strokes.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a name="sec5"></a>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;">5. <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Challenges around Treatment</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Drug Costs and Access to Treatment</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis C drugs are expensive – as much as $1,000 a pill. But they offer great promise – the real possibility of cure for many HCV carriers, and preventing a countless number of future infections.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">How drugs are priced, the profits they generate and the benefits they confer are the subject of much debate, and nowhere more so than when it comes to hepatitis C, because of the tremendous numbers of people infected.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some believe the price the pharmaceutical companies are asking for new drugs like Harvoni are based on what they can extract from governments and insurance companies rather than actual costs plus a reasonable return. Companies argue that the cost of research and development are astronomical and the drugs, while highly-priced, are a good investment because of the benefits to sufferers and the future HCV cases that will be prevented.</p>\r\nIn reality, we often don’t know the actual price paid, because list prices vary by country, and insurance plans, private and public, negotiate discounts.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CyomWClUeGk?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\nWith HIV/AIDS drugs, these tiered pricing schemes, and agreements signed with generic companies have brought prices down markedly and made treatment available to millions.\r\n\r\nWill the same thing happen with hepatitis C drugs?\r\n\r\nWe don’t know.\r\n\r\nWhat is known is that strong advocacy and the involvement of high-profile global health groups like The Global Fund, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Clinton Foundation created tremendous pressure to find solutions. Hepatitis C does not have that profile and the backing of people with star power – at least not yet.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wZVs9zImIBQ?feature=oembed&amp;start=2" width="604" height="340" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Who to treat and follow up?</em>\r\n\r\nCurrent European and American guidelines do not recommend treating all those who test positive as soon as they are found. Most infected are asymptomatic for years and considered in no urgent need of treatment. Giving the medication too early may cause more harm than benefit.\r\n\r\nBased on the progression of disease, the physician will decide when to start the treatment. However, there is no universal agreement on when that time is.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ptks9wMhJXY?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment rids the body of the hepatitis C virus, but it does not eliminate or reverse liver disease. So the word “cure” is a bit misleading. Still, if the progression of disease can be halted, there should be less liver disease in the future, and that holds out the promise of drastically reducing the need for liver transplants, a very costly procedure. But reaping those savings in some distant future comes with a heavy price in the here and now. Today, health care systems are hit twice - they have to pay for the treatment as well as for liver transplants for those who have had chronic infection. To those already in need of a new liver the cure has come too late.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> <em>Will lowering the price of the drugs solve all problems? </em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Not necessarily. Of course it will make the drugs more accessible, but some of the bottlenecks in the system will remain, even if the drugs were available for free.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the first hurdles to overcome is having the drug registered within every country in which it is going to be used. The pharmaceutical company holding the rights to a product may not want to register it, because it will be too costly compared to what they can expect to earn.

Liver inflammation or damage can compromise liver function.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Acute Hepatitis </strong>C virus infection is a short-term illness that occurs within the first 6 months after someone is exposed to the Hepatitis C virus. For most people, acute infection leads to chronic infection.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chronic Hepatitis</strong> C virus infection is a long-term illness that occurs when the Hepatitis C virus remains in a person’s body. Hepatitis C virus infection can last a lifetime and lead to serious liver problems, including cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) or liver cancer.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This is because inflammation sustained over an extended period of time leads to liver damage, and repeated attempts to repair the tissue can result in the formation of scars of fibrous tissue.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Liver failure occurs When the liver cannot keep up with the body’s needs anymore, a condition that can be life-threatening and can be cured only by a liver transplant.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">2. <strong><a name="sec2"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Why is the liver so important ?

They are responsible for only 7% of the cases of viral hepatitis in the world.\r\n\r\nIn some rare cases <strong>adenovirus</strong>, <strong>cytomegalovirus</strong> (CMV), <strong>Epstein-Barr virus</strong> (EBV), or <strong>herpes simplex virus</strong> (HSV) can also cause hepatitis.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2041 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-1.jpg" alt="Table 1" width="1894" height="2663" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis D</strong> is caused by Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV). Because HDV needs the hepatitis B virus to replicate and survive in the body, it can only be found in people already infected with HBV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The HBV vaccine will therefore protect against both infections.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Like other hepatitis viruses, HDV is transmitted through contact with infected blood or blood products, semen, or other bodily fluids.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HDV infection of chronically infected HBV-carriers may lead to <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/hepatitis/whocdscsrncs20011/en/index7.html#fulminant">fulminant</a> acute hepatitis, a condition in which the liver produces a severe acute inflammatory response leading to extensive tissue damage and liver failure. It is 10 times more likely that fulminant acute hepatitis will develop in individuals co-infected with HDV and HBV than with other types of hepatitis viruses. It is also more likely for HDV/HDV co-infection to lead to severe chronic active hepatitis, increasing the risk of cirrhosis. Worldwide, more than 10 million people are infected with HDV, with a mortality rate between 2% and 20%, which is ten times higher than for hepatitis B alone.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis E</strong> is caused by Hepatitis E Virus, which infects about 20 million people in the world every year, leading to about 3 million cases of acute hepatitis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is transmitted mainly through contaminated drinking water worldwide, and is more common in East and South Asia. It usually resolves within 4–6 weeks, but in some cases can lead to a fulminant form of hepatitis, responsible for 56,600 deaths in the world every year.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The first vaccine to prevent hepatitis E virus infection has been produced and licensed in China, but is not yet available globally.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">5.<strong><a name="sec5"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How can different viral hepatitis be transmitted and how can transmission be prevented?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis A</strong> is transmitted through <strong>ingestion</strong> of microscopic amounts of fecal material, such as through contaminated food, drink, and objects.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis A transmission happens mainly by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">eating fruits, vegetables, or other foods contaminated during handling</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">eating raw shellfish harvested from contaminated water</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">swallowing contaminated ice.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">These at-risk behaviours should be avoided to prevent transmission, particularly when travelling to countries that have a high or intermediate prevalence of the disease.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vaccination is t</strong>he most effective way to prevent Hepatitis A.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis B</strong> is transmitted by contact with infected blood, semen, or other <strong>body fluids</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis B transmission can therefore happen by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">being born to an infected mother</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">having sexual intercourse with an infected person</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">sharing contaminated needles, syringes, or other injection drug equipment</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">being accidentally pricked by contaminated needlesticks or other sharp instruments (i.e healthcare professionals).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventative measures established for other blood and sexually transmitted diseases, both in healthcare and in everyday life, should be adopted to prevent Hepatitis B transmission.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Like Hepatitis A, the most effective way to prevent Hepatitis B is <strong>vaccination</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis C</strong> is spread through blood-to-blood contact. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water. Nor is it spread through casual contact, such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Infection can happen by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li>sharing contaminated needles, syringes, or other injection drug equipment</li>\r\n	<li>being accidentally pricked by contaminated needlesticks or other sharp instruments (i.e healthcare professionals)</li>\r\n	<li>having received a blood transfusion or organ transplant before the early 1990s in developed countries — when widespread screening for HCV was introduced with increasing levels of efficacy at detecting the virus. In low resource countries, blood safety remains an issue of major concern.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Birth to an infected mother is a less common mode of transmission. According to US Centers for Disease prevention and Control (CDC), approximately 6% of infants born to infected mothers will get Hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV infection can only be prevented by avoiding blood-to-blood contacts.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventative measures should also include getting tattoes and piercings in certified facilities that use sterile instruments. Healthcare workers should follow professional preventative guidelines.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV cannot usually be transmitted sexually. Nevertheless, even if sexual transmission is very uncommon, practices involving blood contact should be considered <em>at risk</em> behaviors. Having a sexually transmitted disease or HIV, having sex with multiple partners, or engaging in rough sex appears to increase a person’s risk of getting Hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Sharing razors and toothbrushes can expose an individual to infection as well.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Still, about 1 out of 4 patients does not know how or when he or she was infected.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a><sup><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"></a></sup></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">People who have recovered from acute hepatitis C and those who have been cured must be careful about prevention, since reinfection is possible.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is as yet, no proven vaccine for HCV.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">6.<strong><a name="sec6"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Why don’t we have a vaccine for HCV?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A vaccine contains a biological agent that is usually an attenuated or replication-deficient version of a disease causing organism. Exposure to this agent will safely stimulate an individual’s immune system to acquire an immunity to the microorganism without causing disease. HCV is a difficult virus to produce a vaccine for because of its genetic diversity. As such, it is a challenge for scientists to find a target on the virus that is common across HCV genotypes and subgenotypes.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In contrast, HBV is easily recognized by the protein called Antigen Australia (HBsAg), and an immunological response against HbsAg can stop the infection, but researchers have not yet found such a promising target in the structure of HCV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The first vaccine for HCV to reach clinical trials was found to be safe and produced a good immune response in the 15 healthy human volunteers who took part in the phase 1 safety trial. Its efficacy is currently under investigation among intravenous drug users in two sites in the USA. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">7.<strong><a name="sec7"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Can blood transfusions still transmit HCV today?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In developed countries<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a>, the first blood test for HCV was introduced in 1990. This test could detect antibodies against HCV proteins. In the USA, screening blood from donors with this HCV test decreased the risk of transfusion-associated HCV infection per unit of blood from 0.36% (1 in 274) to 0.07% (1 in 3300). Today it is estimated that this test has prevented transmission of HCV to 40,000 patients per year in the US. This test wasn’t perfect. Antibodies to HCV weren’t detectable in the blood for at least 12 weeks after infection, and sometimes more than 26 weeks. During this window, tainted blood could therefore appear safe.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A second-generation more sensitive test, able to detect infected blood as early as 10-20 days post infection, was developed and approved in 1992 . It is estimated that this new test prevented an additional 13,000 people from becoming infected with HCV each year.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/history-of-postransfusion-hep.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2058 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/history-of-postransfusion-hep.jpg" alt="history of postransfusion hep" width="567" height="454" /></a></span>Globally<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a>, blood transfusions are not yet as safe as they are in higher-income countries. Of 148 countries that provided WHO data for screening, 41 reported that they lacked the resources to screen all donated blood for one or more of the required transfusion-transmitted diseases (HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In sub-Saharan Africa, 28 out of the 40 countries have yet to implement national quality systems needed to assure effective screening of donated blood. WHO estimates that the lack of effective screening results in up to 5 million new infections of hepatitis C every year in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">8.<strong><a name="sec8"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are the challenges of HCV prevention in lower income countries?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The transmission of hepatitis C persists in most parts of Africa, as well as in other parts of the world, primarily because of traditional habits and a lack of resources in healthcare settings.</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h3Z8DuJnwWM?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> 9.<strong><a name="sec9"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are HCV genotypes, how many strains do we know and how common are they?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There are 7 main genotypes of Hepatitis C . These differences are based on major viral genetic characteristics, i.e. differences in the genetic sequence that may affect functional features of the virus and how it will respond to pharmacological treatments or antiviral drugs like interferon.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Other, more minor, variants can be found within each genotype; HCV is further classified into 67 confirmed and 20 provisional subtypes. The genetic differences between subtypes are more subtle, but these still need to be considered since these can sometimes influence the virus’s response to different kinds of treatments . In genotype 1, for example, the difference between genotype 1a and 1b is relevant in terms of anticipated treatment response and must therefore be assessed before initiating treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The high degree of genetic diversity of HCV continues to pose a significant challenge for achieving successful vaccines and drug therapies that are effective for all genotypes and subtypes, the so-called pan-genotypic treatment. Such an option would be of particularinterest in developing countries, where genotype testing is often unreliable or difficult to perform.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/most-common-genotypes.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2062 alignnone" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/most-common-genotypes-300x188.jpg" alt="most common genotypes" width="450" height="282" /></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some current treatments are said to be pan-genotypic, but in the real world they have different degrees of effectiveness for different genotypes and are not approved for all of them (<em>see</em> treatment module). Doses, length of treatment, and rate of success still partly depend on HCV genotype, and sometimes subtype. Alternative drugs with broader efficacy are currently under investigation.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is possible for a person to be infected with more than one genotype.</p>\r\n<p class="alignleft" style="text-align: justify;">Globally, the most common genotype is G1 (42% of all HCV cases), followed by G3 (26%) and G4 (17%). The most common subtype is 1b (27%).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Global distribution of different genotypes shows different prevalence in different areas of the world.</p>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence-map_genotypes.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2063 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence-map_genotypes.jpg" alt="prevalence map_genotypes" width="950" height="404" /></a><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Map taken from Messina et al, 2014 (Fig 1A)</strong></span>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Genotype 1 (subtype 1b), is the most prevalent genotype in higher income countries, followed by genotype 3.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The global distribution of HCV genetic variation could be related to historical and contemporary trends in human migration. For example, strains from West Africa (genotype 2) could have been brought to the Americas through the trans-Atlantic slave trade.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One possible explanation for the global distribution of genotype 1 is its association with the most common cause of HCV infection in the 20th century — the distribution of contaminated blood and blood products before HCV screening of blood began. In fact, genotype 1 is prevalent in developed countries, where blood transfusions were more available and widespread: a hypothesis is that the most common sources of blood in those years were from areas where this genotype was prevalent.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The global dissemination of genotype 3 is more likely to be attributed to the association of subtype 3a with injection drug use and to population migration in United Kingdom during colonialism from countries where subtype 3a is dominant, such as India and Pakistan.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if genotype 1 and 3 infections are more prevalent than all other genotypes globally. Genotypes found more commonly in lower-income countries still account for a significant proportion of HCV cases worldwide. Specifically, genotype 2 is most frequent in West Africa and parts of South America (the latter likely reflecting population movements resulting from the trans-Atlantic slave trade), while genotypes 4 and 6 are common in Central/North Africa and East/Southeast Asia, respectively.</p>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/be-aware-box_1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2070 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/be-aware-box_1.jpg" alt="be aware box_1" width="1205" height="378" /></a>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">10.<strong><a name="sec10"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are the symptoms of hepatitis C?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Most people with hepatitis C do not have symptoms and do not know they are infected until their liver has sustained significant damage.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A chronic viral hepatitis infection can present without any symptoms for decades.\r\nHowever, it is possible to experience the following symptoms:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>feeling unusually tired all the time</li>\r\n	<li>depression</li>\r\n	<li>jaundice</li>\r\n	<li>a general sense of feeling unwell</li>\r\n	<li>abdominal pain or bloating</li>\r\n	<li>loss of memory</li>\r\n	<li>itchy skin</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Since these symptoms are very vague, and similar to those reported in many other common diseases, people are often unaware of their condition until they develop cirrhosis, when scar tissue replaces healthy tissue in the liver and prevents the liver from working properly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The early stages of cirrhosis can be as insidious as the previous phases, with very few or no symptoms experienced by the individual, but as the liver loses its ability to function properly, a loss of appetite, nausea and itchy skin become more and more common.\r\nAs the disease progresses, and liver functions are affected, many new symptoms tend to develop:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">weight loss and muscle wasting</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">tenderness or pain around the liver area</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">blood capillaries on the skin above waist level</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">a tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequent nosebleeds or bleeding gums</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">hair loss</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">fever and shivering attacks</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">swelling in the legs, ankles and feet due to a build-up of fluid (edema)</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">swelling in abdomen, due to a build-up of fluid known as ascites</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Changes in personality, insomnia, memory loss, confusion and difficulty concentrating are caused by an encephalopathy that can occur when toxins affect the brain, because the liver is unable to remove them from the body.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">11.<strong><a name="sec11"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How often does the disease progress into a chronic infection and what happens to the liver?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the WHO, at least 15% of infected persons spontaneously clear the virus within 6 months of infection, without any treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The remaining 55–85% of persons will develop a chronic HCV infection. When chronic Hepatitis C develops, it can result in long-term health problems, including liver damage, liver failure, liver cancer, and even death.\r\nOf those with chronic HCV infection, the risk of cirrhosis of the liver is 15–30% within 20 years.\r\nChronic hepatitis C is the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer and the most common reason for liver transplantation in the United States.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">For every 100 persons infected with HCV, approximately 1–5 will die from the consequences of chronic infection (liver cancer or cirrhosis) (source CDC).</p>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/z_liver-damage_timeline_1-flat-small.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2036 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/z_liver-damage_timeline_1-flat-small.jpg" alt="liver damage_timeline_final" width="2508" height="1751" /></a>\r\n\r\nbased on http://www.hepatitisc.uw.edu/go/evaluation-staging-monitoring/natural-history/core-concept/all\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCyoHQ-KKaw?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> 12.<strong><a name="sec12"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How can Hepatitis C be diagnosed?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In most cases infection is identified when the patient is screened for blood donation or when elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT, a liver enzyme) levels are detected during routine medical exams.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When HCV infection is suspected, a blood test is performed to search for antibodies against HCV. If the test detects the presence of antibodies, a second test is performed to directly establish whether the virus itself is currently present in the individual.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/org-chart_good-one2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2279 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/org-chart_good-one2.jpg" alt="org chart_good one2" width="907" height="2750" /></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">...</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9S1ycVi9gA?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C is based on the detection of both anti-HCV antibodies and direct detection of the HCV virus in the presence of biological (i.e. abnormal levels of liver enzymes in blood tests) or histological (that can be seen examining small parts of liver tissue taken by biopsy) signs of chronic hepatitis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Having anti-HCV antibodies (anti-HCV positive) in blood does not necessarily mean that an individual has an active hepatitis C infection. The presence of antibodies is an indication that a person has at some point in the past mounted an immune response againt HCV. Approximately 20% of the infected people clear the virus within 6 months, and these individuals will continue to carry antibodies againt HCV. Anti-HCV-positive, HCV RNA negative individuals should be retested for HCV RNA three months later to confirm true convalescence. After that, they are not considered to have hepatitis C. Although no longer infected, they will still test positive for anti-HCV antibodies all their lives. Since they don’t host the virus in their blood, they cannot spread the disease.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the presence of both anti-HCV antibodies and the HCV virus in blood indicates the presence of a hepatitis C infection and, consequently, that the person is infectious. If the direct HCV test is negative within 6 months, the patient had acute hepatitis C. If the test continues to yield positive results beyond 6 months, the patient is diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">After that time, it is very rare for the immune system to clear the virus and for the test to be negative.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, HCV antibodies are not protective against reinfection, which can occur after successful treatment as well (See <em>Treatment</em> module for more information).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2283 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2.jpg" alt="Table 2" width="2033" height="556" /></a>A laboratory test for identifying the genotype (and 1a/1b subtype) of the hepatitis C strain and an assessment of liver damage will guide treatment choices.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Establishing the amount of virus present, or the “viral load” can also help predict a treatment’s success.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A test of the patient’s DNA can help determine how effective certain drugs can be against HCV. Variants of a gene involved in the immune response against HCV (Interleukin 28B, IL28B), can alter the effect of certain HCV treatments (See Treatment module).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">13.<span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff;" name="sec13"></a>How can liver damage be assessed?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main factors influencing the type and timing of treatment is the severity of liver disease.\r\nPatients with cirrhosis have to be identified since their treatment regimen needs to be adapted accordingly. The fibrosis stage can be assessed initially with imaging (ultrasound scan, MRI,…), liver stiffness measurement, and identification of biomarkers in the blood.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Liver stiffness measurement (FibroScan®) measures how quickly vibrations pass through the liver. The more ‘stiff’ or damaged the liver is, the more quickly the waves will pass through it .</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Blood biomarkers include several direct markers which correlate with, or are part of, the liver matrix that is produced in the fibrosis process. Other indirect markers reflect changes in liver function. They are molecules released into the blood when there is inflammation of the liver.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Both stiffness measurement and biomarkers can distinguish quite well between cirrhosis and no-fibrosis. Combined, these tests can identify intermediate degrees of fibrosis. These tests reduce the need for an invasive liver biopsy, a procedure that can be problematic for patients with impaired blood clotting capacity.\r\nIn patients without compromised blood clotting, there is little risk of hemorrage from a liver biopsy, since it involves taking a small tissue sample from the liver though the skin by percutaneous core needle, under ultrasound guide. This tissue sample is then examined under a microscope.</p>\r\n14.<strong><a name="sec14"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How is Hepatitis C treated and managed?</span></strong>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When a diagnosis of Hepatitis C is confirmed, the presence or absence of other diseases must be established since this can influence prognosis and treatment. Mycotoxins, as well as alcohol, can make the evolution of the disease more severe. A concurrent infection with HIV, for example, can require a different approach with different drugs, and possible drug interactions must also be considered.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The degree of liver damage and virus genotype are used to drive treatment and management of the disease (see treatment module).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A therapy’s success is evaluated by blood tests showing no detectable virus. A sustained virus response (SVR), is the continued absence of detectable HCV virus in the blood six months (24 weeks) after the end of treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The antiviral Interferon-α was the the first drug treatment for HCV after it was discovered in 1989. In 2011, a more persistent form of interferon-α (Pegylated interferon- α), together with the antiviral drug ribavirin, increased the rates of success. These, however, never exceeded a 50% cure rate, and their heavy side effects often forced patients to discontinue the treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2011, new antivirals called Direct Agent Antivirals (DAA, i.e. protease inhibitors acting directly on the virus instead of on the patient) were introduced, to be given in association with previous drugs (triple therapy regimen). They improved the SVR in up to 75% of patients, but with even worse side effects.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All these therapies were more effective on other genotypes than on genotype 1, the most common in higher income countries. Substantial research efforts led to a new class of DAA. The first to be introduced was sofosbuvir in 2014. The new therapies are even more effective on genotype 1 than on others, approaching 95% of success rates in clinical trials with fewer and milder side effects.\r\nNow, the real challenge is providing access to these revolutionary drugs (please refer to Treatment section for success rates of the DAA in other genotypes). They are very expensive and on a global scale most healthcare systems and patients cannot afford them.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This has made hepatitis C therapy more a policy issue than a medical one.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9S1ycVi9gA?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>REFERENCES</strong>\r\n\r\nPrati, D.

(45, 1, '2015-10-11 21:47:01', '2015-10-11 21:47:01', '<h2></h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">A WORLDWIDE SILENT KILLER</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p>by <strong>André Picard</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;Worldwide, an estimated 550 million people have been infected with viral hepatitis, a family of viruses that can cause debilitating liver diseases like cirrhosis and liver cancer.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Between them, hepatitis B and C kill almost 1.5 million people annually - more than any of the « big three » infectious diseases : HIV-AIDS (1.4 million), tuberculosis (1.4 million) and malaria (700,0000)– that capture most of the public attention and research dollars, and mobilize political action.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Through determined global public health campaigns, the infection rates and mortality rates of AIDS, TB and malaria are all falling. But hepatitis cases and mortality are still rising sharply : Consider that the number of hepatitis C deaths has quadrupled in the last decade.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Viral hepatitis is one of the most common and deadly infections on the planet, but, for a variety of reasons, the scourge is well down the list of public health and political priorities and, as a result, gets a negligible amount of media coverage.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Why do we hear so little about the scourge of hepatitis ?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a variety of reasons.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">First and foremost, hepatitis kills slowly and silently. The virus can damage the liver over a period of decades before a person has visible signs of cancer or cirrhosis. But the virus can be merciless. About one in five people infected with viral hepatitis will develop cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) that can necessitate a transplant, and 1-5 per cent will die of liver cancer.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the stealth nature of the infection, a large number of sufferers – up to 40 per cent by some estimates – are unaware of their infection. Patterns of infection vary markedly between countries, meaning there is no single global pandemic, but hundreds of overlapping but seemingly unrelated epidemics.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is also a significant disconnect between the cause and the effect of the infection. Few people make the link between getting a blood transfusion as a child, risky sexual behaviour as an experimenting teenager, or one-time needle-sharing, and contracting liver disease later in life.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is also a lot of stigma attached to hepatitis. The chronic fatigue often associated with infection means that sufferers can be pegged as lazy and unproductive.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Because hepatitis viruses can be transmitted sexually and by injection drug use, there are oftentimes negative stereotypes perpetuated about carriers of the disease. Yet, while many cases of hepatitis are preventable, the reality is that the source of infection is often unknown.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The lack of profile of viral hepatitis means few countries undertake systemic screening and data collection is poor which, in turn, creates a vicious cycle of indifference and inaction.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Journalists and other science communicators can help break that cycle by understanding the reality of hepatitis, including the breadth of the problem, and the challenges of prevention and treatment, as well as the opportunities for change on the horizon.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">LIVER DISEASE</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Liver disease is caused by alcohol abuse : That is an ingrained belief around the world. But there are, in fact, a number of causes, the most common of which is hepatitis (hepa is the Greek word for liver ; -itis means inflammation.).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There are several types of hepatitis – A, B, C, D, E, G - all of which have a common origin. The illness hepatitis has been known for centuries – there are reports of epidemic outbreaks of liver disease dating back to 2000 B.C. This long history robs hepatitis of the cache of newness that propels other infectious diseases like AIDS, SARS and MERS into the headlines.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet, hepatitis is, in many ways, a relatively new story. It was not until World War II that scientists realized that hepatitis was caused by viruses and could be blood-borne as well as water-borne. This breakthrough occurred after a large number of soldiers immunized against yellow fever developed hepatitis due to the re-use of needles, not from contaminated water, as was usually the case.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis B was identified in 1963, hepatitis A in 1973 and hepatitis C (long known as non-A-non-B) not until 1989.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">While they share a common name, the viruses are quite different, and even have different routes of transmission. To complicate matters further, there are different genotypes of the viruses in various parts of the world ; there are already seven hepatitis C genotypes that have been identified.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis A is spread through the fecal-oral route, meaning it is generally food-borne and water-borne, but can also be spread by some sexual practices. Hepatitis A also tends to be an acute illness, much like food poisoning, and is deadly only in rare cases.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis B is spread by contact with bodily fluids such as blood, semen and saliva. The virus can be transmitted sexually, during the birth of a child, or by blood transfusion or contact with a contaminated needle.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Because it is spread easily, hepatitis B is the most common form of liver disease. Some people become acutely ill after infection, but most cases are chronic, eventually causing liver cancer or cirrhosis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Globally, hepatitis B kills about 700,000 people annually. This, even though it is vaccine-preventable. The vaccine, which has been available since 1973, is given to babies and, again, before young people become sexually active.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis C is not as easily spread. It is almost exclusively blood-borne, though it is sometimes sexually transmitted.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is, however, quite deadly, also killing about 700,000 people a year. There is no vaccine. There are, however, medications that can cure hepatitis C.<br>\r\nFor all intents and purposes, hepatitis C should be considered principally a healthcare-acquired infection. Most sufferers contract it through exposure to unsafe blood – for example, untested (or inadequately tested) blood used for transfusions, re-used and inadequately sterilized needles and other surgical/medical equipment, and via tattooing and piercing.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">While hepatitis C is often described as a disease of intravenous drug users, only about 10 per cent of the overall number of cases are believed to be caused by shared needles.<br>\r\nIt is important to bear in mind too that much remains to be learned, particularly about hepatitis C. For example, in about 25 per cent of cases, the route of transmission is unknown.</p>\r\n<p>What we do know is that a significant number of people who are infected with viral hepatitis – perhaps as many as one in four – clear the virus on their own and that many others, because the viruses take so long to damage the liver and cause conditions like cancer and cirrhosis, die of other causes. The lengthy period between infection and illness helps create complacency.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">THE GLOBAL PUZZLE</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Globally, 3-5 per cent of the population is infected with viral hepatitis. But the prevalence varies tremendously by region, by country and even within countries.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In Western countries, where immunization against hepatitis B, screening of blood for hepatitis C antibodies, and universal precautions in healthcare settings are the norm, the infection rate is low – less than two per cent.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In many middle- and low income countries, where vaccination may come late or be incomplete, and where healthcare safety norms are not always followed to the letter because of the cost, the infection rate tends to hover around 5-8 per cent.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">And in some parts of Africa and Asia, where the healthcare infrastructure is severely lacking, and unsafe healthcare practices are commonplace, the rate can be as high as 10-15 per cent.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This distribution of cases is a reminder that, like most infectious diseases, the greatest burden of hepatitis is borne by the poorest countries - those that have the fewest resources to undertake prevention programs and to offer adequate care to those who are sick with hepatic disease – and especially by marginalized populations within every country, such as drug users and sex workers.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One has to bear in mind, however, that a lot of the figures cited are guesswork, estimates extrapolated from small samples.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The data are weak because there is little effort and few resources dedicated to collecting it. Few countries conduct universal screening for hepatitis, and many do not even screen pregnant women or those in high risk groups (as is now the norm with HIV) to cut the chain of transmission.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">That leads a number of researchers to believe that despite the shockingly high estimates of the prevalence of viral hepatitis – 350 million carriers of HBV, 185 million HCV and 15 million other chronic carriers – that those numbers may actually be an under-estimate.<br>\r\nFor example, India reports a hepatitis C infection rate of only one per cent, which beggars belief given the crude health infrastructure in large parts of the populous country, not to mention significant levels of injection drug use. Currently, however, there is little incentive for countries to seek out data, as was the case in the early days of the AIDS pandemic. It was only when efforts (and money) were put into research, prevention and treatment that the true extent of HIV infection became clear, but there is no such effort related to viral hepatitis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">What is unquestionable, regardless of the precise numbers, is that they are going in the wrong direction – ever upwards. There is a large and growing gulf between the burden of hepatitis and the awareness and ability to respond to the challenges.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is also clear that, beyond the regional differences, within countries (even those with good screening and treatment) there are some clearly identifiable risk groups that need to be singled out for particular attention.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Intravenous drug users, particularly those who live on the streets or other low-income settings, are the most obvious risk group because there tends to be a fair bit of needle-sharing and high-risk sex work, and harm reduction programs like needle exchanges are not always in place. In some countries, fully half of IV drug users are infected with hepatitis C, and they can also be co-infected with HIV (which has similar means of transmission), acting as carriers of disease.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In some cultures, there are also high-risk practices like tattooing, piercing, scarification, ritual circumcision and female genital mutilation that put people at increased risk of HCV infection. In Pakistan, a study showed that barbers – who use straight razors to shave customers and often nick them – are a major source of the spread of HCV infection.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In some countries with poor health infrastructure, the use of « traditional » healers is also commonplace and they don’t follow safety practices ; neither do merchants who, in public markets, sell concoctions like vitamin and iron shots.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But, again, the greatest risk still comes in the healthcare setting.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">That reality has also left a legacy. A significant number of people get surgery at some point in their lives, and that often involves a transfusion. As a result, in Western countries such as the U.S and Europe, there are a large number of seniors – notably Baby Boomers – who are now being struck by the ravages of hepatitis. Because exposure to blood is so widespread and many received transfusions before testing was implemented, more people die of hepatitis C than AIDS in North America.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Screening of blood for hepatitis B did not begin until the mid-1970s, blood products were not heat-treated to kill viruses like hepatitis until the mid-1980s, and a test for hepatitis C was not developed and implemented until the early-1990s.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The notion that needles and other medical equipment should not be re-used because of the risks of spreading infection is also relatively recent, and disposable « sharps » are still not the norm in many countries.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Practically, that means a lot of people were exposed to potentially contaminated blood – and may only learn of their exposure decades later when they are diagnosed with liver disease in the form of cancer or cirrhosis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A striking example of this is in Egypt, which has one of the highest incidences of hepatitis C in the world with about one in every seven adults infected. In the early 1980s, Egypt set out to deal with the epidemic of schistosomiasis, a common parasitic disease along the Nile River. The treatment, an injection of tartar emetic, was broadly offered, but needles were re-used and not sterilized. The result was to get rid of schistosmiasis, but to infect hundreds of thousands with HCV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis B vaccine has been available since 1982. It is highly effective, but must be given quickly – preferably within 24 hours of birth – if it is going to be effective.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">That is particularly important in parts of the world where there is a high prevalence of HBV, like East Asia, where mother-to-child transmission is a significant risk factor.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The earlier in life someone is infected, the greater the likelihood they will develop liver cancer or cirrhosis. But, in parts of the world where births tend to be at home, and there is not always ready access to healthcare providers who provide services like neonatal vaccination, many children do not get vaccinated adequately, even if they get their childhood hepatitis B shots later on.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no vaccine that protects against hepatitis C, and there is unlikely to be. There are at least six genetically distinct forms (genotypes) of HCV and more than 50 subtypes have been identified, so it is unlikely that a global vaccine could protect against all the variants.<br>\r\nThe genotypes tend to vary by geographic region. Type 1 HCV is most common in the U.S. and Europe ; type 3 dominates in India, the Far East and Australia and ; type 4 is found most frequently in Africa and the Middle East.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The other main reason vaccine development is on the back burner is that there are effective treatments for hepatitis C. In fact, new drugs are so effective they are being called a cure. But, of course, the word « cure » should be used carefully, because there are some provisos notably that the treatment doesn’t always work, and they do not leave people immune to being infected anew.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment for hepatitis C has been around for a long time. Well before the virus was actually identified, severe liver disease was treated with inteferon, and that was, until recently, the standard treatment for patients beginning to feel the effects of chronic infection with viral hepatitis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Interferon, however, is a long, demanding treatment that has a lot of nasty side effects, and works less than half the time.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Interferon boosts the immune system, while the new drugs work by attacking the virus itself ; they keep HCV from replicating and kill off the existing virus in the body.<br>\r\nCure rates are in the neighborhood of 95-97 per cent in well-controlled trials and about 85-90 per cent in the real world – and, as an added bonus, the drugs have far fewer side effects.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There are, to date, two principal products on the market : A combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir (brand name SOVALDI) and a four drug combo - ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir, and dasabuvir (known as <span lang="EN-GB">VIEKIRAX + EXVIERA</span>).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">These drugs have made headlines largely because of the cost – in the U.S. about $1,000 a pill, or up to $95,000 for a full course of treatment. In India, however, the price is as little as $1,000 in total.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But should not forget that the drugs work differently on various genotypes. They are highly effective on HCV 1 genotype (the one that is predominant in North America and Europe) but quite ineffective on HCV type 3 genotype (which we see in India and Africa).</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence_map_1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2559 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence_map_1.jpg" alt="prevalence_map_1" height="445" width="958"></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;Map taken from Messina et al., 2015</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Relative prevalence of each HCV genotype by Global Burden of Disease region. Size of pie charts are proportional to the number of estimated HCV cases estimated by Hanafiah et al.,2013</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence-map_genotypes.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2063 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence-map_genotypes.jpg" alt="prevalence map_genotypes" height="404" width="950"></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Map Taken from Messina et al., 2015 - Distribution of most common HCV genotypes.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Again, the gap in care is growing between rich and poor countries: The issue is not only cost but the fact that the new drugs are most effective in treating HCV genotypes most prevalent in the developed world. Thankfully, there are new drugs in the pipeline that will address this problem, though whether they will be affordable is another matter.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The other bit of good news is that, because the new HCV drugs work on different parts of the virus, it is unlikely that resistance will develop, as has been the case with AIDS drugs.<br>\r\nStudies show these new hepatitis drugs are cost-effective at least on an individual basis, because treating the diseases that HCV causes, with liver transplants and cancer treatment, is extremely costly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The larger issue, given the high number of people with hepatitis C, is that the cash outlay to treat everyone would be prohibitive, even if drug costs come down considerably. It is often said that the new treatments will bankrupt drug plans, which is a bit of rhetorical overkill. As with all new expensive drugs, choices will have to be made, and prices should come down over time.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">What it means, practically, is that not everyone infected with HCV will get treated immediately ; there will have to be a prioritization and selection process. Guidelines are already being developed, and they are based on severity of illness, genotype, co-morbidities and drug interactions with treatments for other disease.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Given the effectiveness of these new treatments, there have been moves to step-up screening, which raises a host of practical and ethical issues.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The debate about the cost of treating and curing hepatitis C has focused too narrowly on drugs, which are only a portion of the overall cost.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As with HIV-AIDS drugs, there are discussions about the need to bring down prices, especially in resource-poor settings. Pharmaceutical companies will have an important role to play in these negotiations, and having patent pools and deals with generic makers will likely be solutions.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But having cheaper drugs is only one part of the equation, and the cost.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are going to treat, you first have to test. Screening tests are relatively inexpensive, but genotype testing is not. You also have to test liver function to help determine who is sickest, and to judge effectiveness of the treatment. All of this requires hi-tech laboratories and well-trained personnel. Not to mention a decent healthcare system.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Most important of all is that, even if you cure someone of their HCV infection, their liver disease does not magically disappear. Damage to the organ has occurred over decades, and can still result in liver cancer or cirrhosis, so the promised savings are likely to not be as great as assumed.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Cure is not the same as a vaccine either. People can be re-infected, even after expensive treatment. Given that reality, do you deny treatment to those with high-risk behaviors?<br>\r\nEven the idea of universal screening – and, in many countries, liver disease support groups advocate that all people born prior to 1975 be tested – raises some thorny ethical dilemmas.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If you test everyone do you have an obligation to treat everyone? Is it ethical – and responsible – to tell someone they are infected with a cancer-causing agent and then turn around and say treatment costs are prohibitive so they are ineligible ? If you test, will the infected be stigmatized and discriminated against, for example putting their jobs in peril ?<br>\r\nThese new treatments may be a medical miracle, but they are also a nightmare for policy-makers, especially those whose job it is to contain health budgets.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">THE END GAME</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is not a single country on Earth that is free of hepatitis C. Yet, the promising medical developments that make it possible – at least in theory – to cure most sufferers have some public health advocates dreaming big after years of being relegated to the shadows.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is now open and hopeful talk of hepatitis C « elimination » by 2030. That does not mean eradicating the disease (although that is theoretically possible because there is no insect vector or animal reservoir for HCV). Rather, the ambitious goal is to have 90 per cent of people who are infected with HBV or HCV to be screened and diagnosed, and for 90 per cent of those eligible for treatment have their condition suppressed or cured. This approach mirrors the 90-90-90 strategy for eliminating HIV-AIDS by 2030.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is estimated that meeting those targets would reduce the number of people infected with viral hepatitis by 70 per cent and cut the mortality rate by half within the next generation.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment is only part of the solution. There is not an effective treatment or cure for hepatitis B but there is a vaccine and, after 20 years on the market, it is finally starting to have a significant impact on infection rates.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Because viral hepatitis is principally acquired in the healthcare setting, it is also important to cut infection at the source. Campaigns like Safer Healthcare Now are helping educate and inform the public and health care providers about the importance of hand hygiene, the appropriate use of antibiotics, and monitoring surgical sites to reduce the risk of infections. Public policies that also inadvertently undermine prevention of hepatitis, like the so-called War on Drugs, also have to be abandoned in favor of evidence-based harm reduction initiatives like supervised injection sites, or needle exchanges to decrease the risk of disease spread.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The only way to to rein in the ever-worsening and ever-more deadly epidemic of viral hepatitis is with a concerted global effort, similar to the response to AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria – and it has to be said that the « big three » infectious diseases have a considerable head start. Research is particularly lacking and underfunded; if you want to eliminate a disease, you have to have a solid grasp on how it is transmitted, and on the barriers to prevention and treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Viral hepatitis was long taken for granted, even by global public health agencies like the World Health Organization.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2006, when the Millenium Development Goals were drafted, viral hepatitis was notably absent. It had no champions. At the WHO, an organization with 8,000 employees, there was not a single person with responsibility for hepatitis in their title. Meanwhile there were entire agencies and divisions for AIDS, TB and malaria.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The impetus for change came from the grassroots, from patients. In 2007, hepatitis support groups in a number of countries joined forces to create the World Hepatitis Alliance, and one of their first initiatives was to create World Hepatitis Day, which occurred for the first time on May 19, 2008.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Two years later, the WHO created a global hepatitis program and, in 2014, it published the first guidelines for the screening, care and treatment of HBV and HCV. That same year, the World Health Assembly called on every country to adopt national strategies for dealing with viral hepatitis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The desire – and need – to draft and implement such strategies was given a considerable boost by the arrival of new drugs. The message being driven home by groups like the World Hepatitis Alliance is that countries simply cannot sit on the sidelines anymore; they have to be part of the conversation.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The advent of new treatments, combined with the empowerment of patients, has helped break the silence surrounding this age-old killer.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is now a rare opportunity to significantly prevent and treat millions of cases of cancer and other deadly liver diseases. There is, in essence, a solution – or, more accurately, solutions – to a millenium old problem.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is also a story – no, stories – to be told. But those stories need to be factual, nuanced and evidence-informed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'The disease', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '18-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-10-11 21:47:01', '2015-10-11 21:47:01', '', 18, 'http://localhost/~mpierre1/projects/clients/WFSJ/?p=45', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

It was a manufactured version of interferons, proteins naturally produced in the body that enhance the immune system’s response to viral infection. <strong>Interferon-alfa (IFN-α)</strong> treatment required subcutaneous injections three to five times per week.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2001, two modified forms of interferon were introduced (PEGylated interferons: PegIFN-α2a and PegIFN-α2b). These modified interferons circulated in the body for a longer period of time before being cleared by the kidneys, so injections were only needed once a week.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A drug combination that included <strong>PEGylated interferon-α</strong> later became the standard of care for hepatitis C. <strong>Ribavirin</strong> was administered with <strong>PEGylated interferon-α</strong> to enhance its effects, but despite this improvement, still less than half of patients benefitted from treatment. Genotype 1, the most common strain of Hepatitis C in higher income countries, was particularly unresponsive to these drugs. The treatment regimen required ingestion of several capsules of ribavirin per day and one injection per week of PEGylated interferon for 48 weeks. Many people abandoned therapy prematurely because of intolerable side effects such as flu-like symptoms, including fever and weakness. Anemia was also common and often severe. Some patients reported that their treatment had a significant impact on mood, leading to feelings of depression (See<strong> Figure 1</strong>).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">These treatments improved the patient’s natural response against HCV, but did not target the virus itself. Efficacy was low, while side effects were significant.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A cure against HCV genotype 1, the most common strain of HCV in high income countries, remained elusive. Drug companies saw a large and potentially profitable market so they steered funds and resources towards this branch of research. Publicly funded research was also aggressively investigating viral hepatitis C during this period.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">These efforts led to the development of a new class of drugs – the direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). This class of drug does not affect the patient’s immune system, but attacks the virus itself, blocking one or more steps of its life-cycle. The precise mechanism of the different DAAs will be explored in s<strong>ection 2</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2011, the protease inhibitors were the first DAAs to be introduced, named for their ability to inhibit viral protein synthesis. <strong>Boceprevir</strong> and <strong>telaprevir</strong>, both given orally in combination with PEGylated interferon-α and ribavirin, improved cure rates (the percentage of people cured)― up to 75% for genotype 1, but they also produced additional side effects to those already present with previous treatments and increased the overall burden of side effects proportionately (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Another research breakthrough led to the development of new HCV DAAs that could inhibit viral replication. Their first passage from clinical trials to the real world was a disappointment, however; despite good results in initial trials, these treatments proved to be less effective and more toxic (even fatal) when used in the field.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The turning point was in 2014. A new class of direct acting antivirals (DAA) was released on the market. <strong>Sofosbuvir</strong> was very effective on genotype 1 and produced successful results in a great majority of patients. Administered in combination with PEGylated interferon and ribavirin, Sofosbuvir tablets produced a cure rate of over 90 % of patients with hepatitis C genotype 1, 2, 3 and 4. In addition, the new treatment was much shorter (usually 12-24 weeks), simple to take, and very well tolerated.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In the months that followed, other DAA drugs and DAA drug <strong>combinations</strong> with comparable dramatic success rates were approved (see table 1). Indeed, it had become clear that by combining more than one drug, each acting on a different aspect of the virus life cycle, the highly mutable Hepatitis C virus could be stopped, and its resistance to treatment prevented (see <strong>section 2</strong> for a discussion on <em>how drug combinations successfully provide a high barrier to resistance</em>).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Another advancement between late 2014 and early 2015, was the discovery that interferon-free regimens (sometimes even without ribavirin) can be equally effective, showing that it may be possible to circumvent the worst treatment side effects that continued to hinder treatment and compliance in some patients.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Figure-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2460 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Figure-1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" height="487" width="828"></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAware-BOX-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2462 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAware-BOX-1.jpg" alt="BeAware BOX 1" height="1047" width="1992"></a>The development of the new DAA drugs caused a major shift in the hepatitis C treatment landscape –they could be used to treat every patient with the disease. However getting access to them would prove difficult. Their prohibitive price has meant that they are beyond the reach of a majority of patients, especially in low and middle income countries.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All over the world, patient associations, doctors and health authorities are advocating for industries to drop these prices in order to treat as many patients as possible, as was done for HIV/AIDS drugs.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This has shifted the focus of the hepatitis C problem from a medical issue to one of public policy. Political, economic, and ethical issues surrounding access to care and who pays the costs of medical research, drug development and marketing, are at the forefront of this rapidly evolving health issue.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/50w8LdjdYIo?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe><br>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-11.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2461 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-11.jpg" alt="Table 1" height="2988" width="2039"></a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cjszp5h6Q04?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul style="font-size: 15px; color: black;">\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;According to their mechanism of action, the new DAAs drugs can be classified into 4 classes:<br>\r\n1. the first class, <strong>NS3-4A protease inhibitors</strong>, block the production of <strong>viral proteins</strong> (i.e. simeprevir, paritaprevir)</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">All the other three classes block the production of <strong>viral genes</strong> (RNA).<br>\r\nThese include:<br>\r\n2. <strong>Nucleotide analogues</strong> that inhibit the enzyme (NS5B polymerase) needed for viral replication (i.e. sofosbuvir);<br>\r\n3.<strong> Non-nucleotide analogues</strong> that inhibit the same enzyme (NS5B polymerase) needed for viral replication but with a different mechanism (i.e. dasabuvir);<br>\r\n4. <strong>NS5A inhibitors</strong> block both the replication and the assembly of the virus (i.e. ledipasvir, daclatasvir, ombitasvir,..)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As of July 2015, the approved treatments available for treating Hep C are summarized in the following table:</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2b_revised_smaller.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2725 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2b_revised_smaller.jpg" alt="Table 2b_revised_smaller" height="1061" width="1198"></a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAwareBOX-2.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2469 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAwareBOX-2.jpg" alt="BeAwareBOX 2" height="336" width="1192"></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Many other new molecules and combinations are currently under investigation in order to simplify the treatment and tackle the few patients resistant to the current available drugs.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">2) <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">How is the efficacy of anti HCV drugs measured? Is the currently used outcome reliable?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The best way to assess the efficacy of anti HCV drugs as well as of any other treatment would be through well designed randomized, placebo controlled trials - possibly independent from industry - that would measure the effect of drugs on the progression of liver disease and on the risk of illness/morbidity and mortality. These would prove that the new drugs not only cure infection, but can prevent more advanced liver disease and deaths that happen decades later in people with chronic infection.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However disease progression of chronic hepatitis C is very slow. Conditions like cirrhosis and liver cancer take decades to develop and these clinical outcomes must be measured 20-30 years after the <strong>time</strong> of treatment. These types of trials would be very costly. Furthermore, a relatively small proportion of patients develop a severe disease (15-30% of patients with chronic hepatitis develop <strong>cirrhosis</strong> and 3-17% of patients with cirrhosis develop<strong> liver cancer</strong>), so <strong>large numbers</strong> of participants would need to be included in these trials to reach statistical significance. There are also ethical considerations, regarding the use of a placebo control group in this case!</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A surrogate outcome is therefore used in these situations. This is a measure that does not directly assess the important outcome (ie.: reducing severe liver disease and death), but is believed to reflect the important outcome. The measure used here is the continued absence of hepatitis C virus in blood for 6 months which is referred to as a sustained virologic response (SVR)).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The reliability of this outcome has been questioned by some experts because it is not clear whether the virus might “hide” in certain cellular compartments and body tissues while the bloodstream is clear of virus. Several studies conducted in the past with older therapies showed however that a sustained response usually corresponds to 1) a lack of virus in other body tissues -indeed, the idea that the virus could hide in so called “sanctuaries”, i.e. other tissues, as HIV does, has never been proven and 2) less liver related illness/morbidity and mortality compared with people without a sustained response</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">3) <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">How effective are the new HCV drugs in clinical trials and in the real world?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Indeed, recent clinical trials on the new drugs for HCV, the DAAs, are reporting 85-100% cure rates across genotypes, with the precise level of effectiveness depending on the genotype and drug combination. However, it is important to note that these drugs are still under investigation, and we do not yet have much data on what the results will be in the field– Real life is always messier in terms of treatment safety and efficacy. Below are the issues that must be considered when interpreting clinical trial results.</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAwareBOX-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2486" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAwareBOX-3-1024x672.jpg" alt="BeAwareBOX 3" height="590" width="900"></a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;The 5-15% matter:</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, even a small percentage, such as the 5-15% of patients that will not respond to treatment or experience a relapse, can represent a very large absolute number of patients that could fail treatment when it comes to treating millions of people all over the world.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If we anticipate that 10 per cent of patients will not experience success with the new drugs, then 15 million people in the world will not be cured with treatment. So we can say that the great majority of patients today in theory could be cured, but not all of them. Issues with resistance will also arise in this patient population, because treatment failure will represent selection of drug-resistant viruses, and alternate second-line treatment choices will be limited.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-3_revisedFINAL_smaller.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2745 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-3_revisedFINAL_smaller.jpg" alt="Table 3_revisedFINAL_smaller" height="965" width="604"></a></p>\r\n<p align="center">&nbsp;<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ywQQ9zfpbDY?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>4) <strong><a name="sec4"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What drives the choice of treatment?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The choice of treatment for chronic hepatitis C is driven by many factors linked to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">the<strong> virus genotype</strong> (and sometimes subtype)</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">the <strong>stage of liver disease</strong> (especially the presence of cirrhosis)</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">patient’s <strong>clinical history</strong> (such as being treated before/having undergone a treatment failure)</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">The patient’s <strong>genetic characteristics</strong> (for example which ethnic group they are part of) can have an impact on the efficacy of older drugs. A variant of gene <strong>IL28B</strong> – a gene involved in the immune response to HCV. There are three IL28B subtypes – CC, CT, TT. If a person has the CC variant of the gene, the individual is not only more likely to clear the virus without treatment during the acute phase, if a chronic infection does develop it is 3 times likely that PegIFN and Ribavirin will cure infection.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, the presence of a<strong> Q80K</strong> genetic variant that develops in certain strains of HCV makes the virus less susceptible to simeprevir.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Possible co-infections</strong> (i.e. with Hepatitis BVirus and/or HIV) do not influence therapeutic approaches with the new drugs, but still need to be considered in all those settings where the latest treatments are not available.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, the most relevant, often critical, factor in the choice of treatment in most parts of the world is currently the <strong>access to the new drugs.</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This issue will be dealt with in a following section.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL 2015), as well as the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) rely on <strong>clinical aspects</strong> to formulate treatment recommendations. These recommendations identify the best approved treatment options (either in Europe or in the USA) for each patient based on current scientific evidence.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">On this basis, without considering economic issues, the EASL 2015 guidelines recommend interferon-free regimens as the best option, when available, in all HCV infected patients because of their effectiveness, ease of use, and tolerability.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Where new drugs are not available, either PegIFNα+ ribavirin or triple combination with telaprevir or boceprevir (protease inhibitors) remain acceptable in selected patients likely to respond, at least until new drugs become available and affordable.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The choice of treatment is mainly based on HCV genotype, HCV subtype and viral load. Also to be considered is whether the patient has cirrhosis, or has been treated previously with other drugs.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Different options, unless otherwise indicated, are equally effective, so that doctors can choose what is best and economically feasible for each patient, according to the reimbursement conditions in their own country.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dEtaTAzfWKg?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>THE CHOICE OF TREATMENT ACCORDING TO EASL 2015</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-4B-copy.gif"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2492 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-4B-copy.gif" alt="Table 4B copy" height="5368" width="2790"></a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><strong>5) <span style="color: #3366ff;">Could widespread use of the new drugs lead to emergence of resistant strains?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the hepatitis C virus can change or mutate, some strains naturally acquire genetic characteristics that make them resistant to one treatment or another. When an antiviral drug is given, it blocks replication in all sensitive viruses. Those viruses that are resistant are able to proliferate in that patient. The patient does not respond to treatment anymore and the disease grows. To avoid this, a combination of drugs that affect different aspects of HCV viral replication have always been given together, for a duration that is sufficient to eliminate the infection.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite this, some patients still become resistant to treatment and other options have to be found. The best strategy for these cases is still under investigation.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c_vxvCY1_qc?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">6<a name="sec6"></a><strong>)<span style="color: #3366ff;"> Do new drugs have side effects?</span></strong><br>\r\nThe new drugs against hepatitis C, the so-called “second-generation DAAs”, are very well tolerated by patients and cause <strong>fewer, and much less severe, side effects</strong> than the previous treatments. Patients who were previously treated with earlier generations of medications report a significant difference.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, it cannot be said that this issue has been completely overcome. Many regimens still require<strong> interferons and/or ribavirin</strong> because of the characteristics of the virus and the stage of liver disease. The side effects of these drugs (anemia, low white cell count, headache, fatigue, skin rashes and so on) must be considered by all the patients for whom interferon and ribavirin-free treatment <strong>cannot be prescribed</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The risk of adverse events may always be considered an acceptable alternative to liver failure or cancer in patients with advanced liver disease. However for those without concurrent liver disease the risks associated with treatment may be less acceptable, as only a fraction of them will go on to develop serious consequences.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, safety data on new treatments are still limited, since <strong>post-marketing surveillance</strong> (i.e. the recording of any registered side effect when a drug is on the shelves) for most of these drugs has just begun. Post-marketing surveillance is always important, but even more so for new drugs such as these, which were approved very rapidly because of their ability to cure infection and save lives.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In the clinical trials, the rate of serious adverse events (resulting in persistent disability, hospital admission, or death) was very low (0,5-3%) . Such a<strong> small percentage</strong>, could still represent a significant<strong> absolute number</strong> of cases if millions of people are treated. Of the estimated 150 million people in world who are infected chronic HCV, this percentage of adverse events would represent 750, 000 to 4.5 million people affected.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treating hundreds of thousands people could also reveal <strong>rare side effects</strong> unlikely to be detected in trials with fewer participants.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the safety profile of these drugs needs to be evaluated in <strong>unselected patients</strong>, who can have other concurrent diseases, genetic characteristics, be of different ages and ethnic groups.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The main cause for concern at the moment is the risk of <strong>drug interactions</strong>. This kind of side effect can more easily emerge when treatment is given in the real world, where patients can have other diseases for which they take medications not considered during clinical trials.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">An example of this is the recent FDA advisory about <strong>amiodarone</strong>, a drug used to treat the irregular beating of the heart (arrhythmias). When taken with simeprevir and other antivirals, severe (even fatal) bradycardia has been reported prompting the US FDA to published an alert against the concomitant use of these two medications.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uUuTnWO0PWU?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><strong>7) <span style="color: #3366ff;">Does co-infection with HIV change the management of hepatitis C?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a significant amount of stigma associated with HIV and HCV. Both are infectious diseases which in and of itself is sufficient to lead to stigma and discrimination, especially if the diseases and their methods of transmission are not well understood by the general public. Further, in certain countries the incidence of these viruses is highest among intravenous drug users.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Co-infection with HIV does not have an impact on the success rate of the new direct antivirals. However co-infected patients still require more attention because they have a higher risk of drug-drug interactions and their impaired immune systems could let the disease progress more quickly and aggressively.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>8<a name="sec8"></a><strong>) <span style="color: #3366ff;">Who determines dosage?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Optimal dosage and length of anti HCV treatments have been established in clinical trials. The recommended dosage is a set parameter, not to be changed. However, the degree of “aggressiveness” of a drug therapy can be changed by altering: 1) the number of drugs in the combination and 2) the length of treatment. “Overtreatment” may be advisable in real life settings for patients who are more difficult to cure. However, under-treatment without supporting evidence could lead to the emergence of dangerous resistant strains.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gNugNchJGUg?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><strong><a name="sec9"></a>9) <span style="color: #3366ff;">Who should be tested?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the vast majority of people are unaware of their condition because they are asymptomatic or experiencing symptoms too generic to arouse suspicion, patients must first be identified before addressing treatment issues. This can be done by <strong>screening</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There are controversial <strong>policy issues</strong> surrounding the ethics of screening, particularly if a country does not have the resources to treat the number of individuals that are expected to be identified. This is discussed at length in the<em> public policy module</em>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some countries recommend screening people with risk factors such as current or previous injection drug users or those who received blood transfusions prior to implementing safe screening strategies. Other countries recommend screening high risk groups, such as those born between 1945-1965 ― a generation that was more exposed to infection before the virus was identified.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As the risk of being infected is higher in these groups, the probability of finding patients with asymptomatic liver disease who would benefit from treatment is higher as well.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Encouraging everybody to get tested, would increase the number of infected people identified. Many of these individuals may have been well for decades (and maybe would have died of other causes before even knowing they were infected by HCV), but they are now suddenly told that they have a disease. Since transmission of HCV is not so easy in everyday life, and common hygienic habits are enough to avoid it, this revelation is unlikely to improve prevention measures markedly. However studies show that people diagnosed with HCV express relief in knowing about their disease as they feel more in control of avoiding infecting those they love. In addition, individuals who become aware of their infection can take measures to help limit further damage to their liver. There are many life style changes that an infected patient can adopt, such as no longer consuming alcohol.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h4KyRlpLhSk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>Add Charles gore video 13 in the policy section--------------------------------------</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a name="sec10"></a>10)<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"> Who should be treated?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that effective and tolerable treatments are available, many patients’ associations, doctors and experts worldwide feel that <strong>all the people infected with HCV</strong> should be treated, irrespective of the state of their liver or of the cost of treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">From a clinical point of view, the goal of treatment is to cure HCV patients of infection to prevent hepatic cirrhosis, or halt cirrhosis before the liver is too damaged to function, known as decompensated cirrhosis. Other long terms effects include liver cancer, and even severe health issues in other parts of the body – including autoimmune conditions and nephropathies, and death.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, the cure reduces the risk of decompensation and cancer. When a patient already has decompensated cirrhosis, the treatment can reduce the need for a liver transplantation. However, it should be noted that the impact on middle-to long term survival in these patients is still unknown.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the 2015 EASL guidelines, <strong>all patients with chronic liver disease</strong> due to HCV should be considered for treatment, with priorities associated to the severity of their condition.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment with an interferon-free regimen is urgent in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and should be prioritized in patients with significant fibrosis or cirrhosis, i.e. with F3 to F4 score on the METAVIR scale of liver disease severity.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In patients with no damage or mild disease the treatment can be either deferred or considered in particular cases of severity (HBV or HIV coinfection, significant extra-hepatic manifestations, debilitating fatigue) or when the risk of transmitting HCV to others is high.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Indications for treatment of chronic hepatitis C in 2015: Who should be treated and when?</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-5.gif"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2493 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-5.gif" alt="Table 5" height="1939" width="4077"></a></p>\r\n<p>Modified from EASL Recommendations on Treatment of Hepatitis C 2015</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qnSKUC7IPU4?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">10) <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Is eradication of hepatitis C the actual goal?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the availability of very effective treatments, complete<strong> eradication</strong> of hepatitis C from the world is not a realistic goal without a vaccine. A much more realistic goal is <strong>control</strong> of the disease, which can be achieved at least in high income countries, through prevention, diagnosis, a good healthcare system and access to drugs.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l4hdxRzmvDs?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><a name="sec11"></a>11.<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"> How much do these new drugs cost?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Negotiations between countries and pharmaceutical companies vary from one country to another. As a result, their price is different from drug to drug and from country to country.<br>\r\nIn the US, when sofosbuvir was introduced, each pill cost about 1000 dollars US, for a total price of 80.000-90.000 dollars for a cycle of 12 weeks.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In Europe different health systems have negotiated different prices, in some circumstances up to half the US price. In Italy, for example, a price/volume system of payment has been established, with the cost of drugs going down the more patients are treated.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In low income countries firms have agreed on a cheaper price. In Egypt a whole cycle of sofosbuvir costs about 500 US dollars. In India, Gilead (the company that owns sofosbuvir) has allowed 11 generic firms to produce the drug at low prices and sell it to about 90 developing countries, with a list of clauses to avoid illicit marketing towards middle and high-income countries.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zge-TvYFc9g?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>12)<a name="sec12"></a> <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">How is (and could) Hepatitis C be treated and managed in low and middle resources countries?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The challenge of Hepatitis C in low and middle income countries is not only about the price of drugs. There are other hurdles to face, such as traditional habits that hinder prevention and facilitate the transmission of the disease, the cost and difficulties of screening and the lack of medical resources. Hepatologists, for example, are very rare in Africa, but infectious disease specialists knowledgeable in liver diseases could be recruited. The network of institutions, facilities and staff built up to address HIV in many low and middle income countries could be now exploited to deal with HCV as well.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When an effective treatment to control AIDS was developed, it seemed costs would be prohibitive for low income countries. Instead, today, thanks to the efforts of governments, industry and non- governmental organizations, most patients who are diagnosed in the world can have access to treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The same result can hopefully be achieved for hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bSaLvzqsRmU?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">REFERENCES</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Ghany MG, Strader DB, Thomas DL, Seeff LB; American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.

Doctors have known about HCV – or, as it was long known, non-A non-B hepatitis - for years, but it was believed to be less problematic than its better known viral cousins, hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Besides, there were other, more formidable, infectious disease challenges that came along, like AIDS, that pre-occupied public health officials and politicians. But quietly, over time, scientific knowledge of hepatitis C grew and, along with it, the sobering realization that it is one of the world’s biggest killers, claiming as many lives as hepatitis B, and even more than malaria.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But, unlike other forms of viral hepatitis, there are effective treatments for HCV, and that means many of the estimated 700,000 deaths the disease claims annually are preventable – at least in theory. These treatments come at a high price and good data are lacking on how many are truly infected on a global scale, and who would benefit most from treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Medicine, however, is only part of the story. HCV is a political and public health challenge on a global scale and, to come to grips with it, we must address many questions:</p>\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">How HCV has become a public health crisis.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">What is the best public health response to the epidemic?</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">Who should be screened, and how?</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">The challenges around treatment beyond cost.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This section will focus on these issues and more, providing fodder for inquisitive journalists.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2.<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"> The Unseen Epidemic: events behind the HCV crisis</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The role of public health is to protect and improve the health of the population, not just individuals. Prevention and health promotion initiatives help routine challenges, such as the spread of infectious diseases, from developing into crises. However, public health officials rarely have the final say on priority-setting, adoption of specific strategies, or how much money will be allocated to the response. That belongs to politicians, and they may accept, ignore, or even go against expert advice, for a host of economic or political reasons.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">How to respond to hepatitis C proved to be a major challenge for public health experts and policy-makers. At first, they had little solid information to guide their response. While scientists had known since the mid-70s that there was a variant of hepatitis that was neither A nor B, they could not pinpoint it. There was no test to detect it and no vaccine to prevent it. They also assumed, quite reasonably that the virus was not that big of a deal because few people fell acutely ill. They would realize only later that the virus gnawed away slowly at the liver and caused grave conditions like liver cancer and cirrhosis decades later.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV was finally given a proper name in 1989, when the virus was discovered. Soon after, an antibody test was developed to screen blood for the virus, and public health officials and regulators began the process of creating blood screening strategies. It was believed that this would help contain the spread of the virus. However, at the time, whether this was necessary was a matter of debate. HCV was seen as a small-scale problem, causing only minor manifestations in relatively few patients, many of whom were believed to clear the infection after the initial symptoms. No one knew HCV caused chronic infections or that carriers of the virus were able to infect others even when they had no obvious signs of illness.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZouPfK_E2j0?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As the global impact of HCV has become apparent, the World Health Assembly - WHO’s governing body - has adopted a number of resolutions. In 2011, July 28 was officially recognized as World Hepatitis Day - to create awareness, strengthen prevention and coordinate a global response. A Global Hepatitis Program has also been set up within the WHO to set standards and issue guidelines to help countries formulate specific hepatitis policies for prevention and treatment.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-lyEJQYBnDM?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Hepatitis C had little profile as a public health issue because was it was thought to be a problem mainly confined to intravenous drug users.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ywPfw-vhEM?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;As screening increased, it was discovered that out of the approximately 150 million individuals living with chronic hepatitis C only some 10 million got it through injection drug use. The vast majority contracted the virus via contact with the health system, through blood transfusions, unsafe injections and other health care exposures with poor infection control practices.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4i2tHXkX_lE?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>Another factor contributing to the crisis might possibly be doctors themselves.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qT_B_pb0XTo?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2>&nbsp;<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">3.</span> P for Public Health: Protection - Prevention - Promotion - Prognosis - Provision</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The role of public health</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Public Health tools for handling HCV could include:</p>\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n<li><strong>Surveillance and patient screening</strong>:<br>\r\nmonitoring national prevalence (number of total cases) and incidence (number of new cases in a given period of time) of the virus, identifying asymptomatic chronic carriers, following these patients to determine when to provide treatment and making sure they adhere to the prescribed regimen</li>\r\n<li><strong>Education:</strong><br>\r\ndisseminating information to the public and health professionals about the disease, risk factors, how to avoid infection, etc. on a regular basis and with a special effort on national and community level to mark World Hepatitis Day on July 28<br>\r\ninitiating health education and training to reduce risk of transmission during exposures in nonmedical (e.g., commercial barbering, body piercing, tattoos, and traditional circumcision) and occupational (e.g., health care and sanitation worker) settings.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Testing Blood products</strong>:<br>\r\ntesting all blood used for transfusions and blood products<br>\r\nvirus inactivation (heat-treatment) of plasma-derived products<br>\r\nencouraging the use of as little transfusion blood as possible</li>\r\n<li><strong>Infection-Control</strong>:<br>\r\nenforcing infection control practices<br>\r\nencouraging the use of therapeutic syringes with features to prevent reuse and injuries as well as safe handling and disposal of sharps and waste<br>\r\nencouraging adequate sterilization of reusable material such as surgical or dental instruments</li>\r\n<li><strong>Counseling:</strong><br>\r\npeople with chronic, asymptomatic HCV<br>\r\nincluding teaching them not to share toothbrushes and razors with others and to let their dentist and other medical workers know of their infection status, giving these individuals the opportunity to protect themselves appropriately</li>\r\n<li><strong>Harm Reduction</strong>:<br>\r\ninitiating harm reduction programs, with counseling, needle-syringe exchange and opiate substitution therapy for injection drug users</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However resources are limited, and as a result, political prioritization guides public health decisions. Public health may make recommendations, but whether or not these recommendations will be acted upon is something that will be determined at the political level. Therefore it is important to understand that there is public health and there are politics and these are not always aligned.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>This is also fertile ground for journalism</em>: to document and explore the discrepancies between promises and action.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventing the spread of HCV does not require reinventing the wheel. Many of these strategies are already used to prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS: the screening of donor blood and blood products, universal infection control practices, education, and harm reduction. A number of the steps that have been used against HIV/AIDS likely helped curb the spread of HCV because they have similar routes of transmission and there is some co-infection.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, HCV can stay active outside the human body much longer than HIV. Consequently, infection control practices (e.g., hand-washing, sterilization of reusable medical equipment, and cleaning of surfaces) have to be even stricter for HCV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All the HIV/AIDS prevention efforts never managed to curtail one significant contributor to the spread of blood-borne infections in low- and middle-income countries: unnecessary injections. In Egypt, where there is a generalized HCV epidemic, the prevalence is highest in people with ongoing or a past history of medical injections. It will require determined education efforts to change the practice of re-using needles for vaccinations and other procedures.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, what is needed most fundamentally to prevent the spread of infectious diseases like hepatitis C is a well-functioning and well-staffed healthcare system – something that does not exist in many countries - along with political will, a willingness to invest in safer healthcare.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YV2zVQC5-z0?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Many countries have only applied a few of the public health tools against HCV. Is that an option?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As most chronic patients are asymptomatic it might seem easy to ignore the disease, but there can be serious impacts on a community or a country’s health care resources. If a large group of individuals begins to exhibit liver disease within the same time frame, as expected in this case, then governments will indeed be faced with an acute problem. What course of action politicians decide to take determines the outcome of this public health issue.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of instituting sound health policies can slow their adoption. For example, when a blood test for HCV became available in the early 1990s, some countries were slow to incorporate it as part of the regular screening of blood in hospitals as they had already spent a considerable amount in the 1980s to set up screening for HIV/AIDS.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Even before HCV was identified in 1989 it was known that a non-A, non-B hepatitis was circulating in the blood supply. It is estimated that in the 1970s in the U.S., the risk of contracting hepatitis from blood-transfusion was as high as 30 per cent. Thanks to screening of donor blood, that risk dropped to almost zero by the year 2000.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WsB0L7KqU18?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Questions worth asking:</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Overuse of (unnecessary) injections with unsterile equipment seems to be a driver in spreading the virus, seen not only in Egypt, but in many low- and middle-income countries.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Can education counter the popular belief that injections works against most everything?</em></li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to make sure that the needle being used in a medical procedure was sterile?</em></li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to make sure that the needle being used for an injection in a market stall was sterile?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A key question that was asked in country after country with regard to tainted blood and HIV/AIDS could also be applied to HCV:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Did public health do enough and in time to curb the spread of non-A, non-B hepatitis? Or did they opt to do nothing to save money?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2>&nbsp;4. <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">The unknowingly infected</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Screening Strategies: How to find those who are infected and do not know it?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>A large number of people infected with HCV are ‛silent carriers‛ - meaning they show no symptoms for years, even decades. How can they be identified? And should they be identified if the resources </em><em>treat them are lacking</em><em>? </em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Universal screening – testing everyone systematically for HCV – is one approach, at least in theory. But, in most countries that is not practical, nor fiscally responsible, given all the other health priorities. Besides, a screening test only confirms past exposure to the virus. That would need to be followed up with other more costly tests that 1) confirm the continued presence of the virus circulating in the blood, and in what amounts, and 2) determine the degree damage to the liver. It is a cascade of testing that can quickly become very costly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ideally, what researchers would like to see is a single, inexpensive blood or serology test that provides all the relevant information. But a test like that is currently only a dream.</p>\r\n<p><em>If you rule out universal screening, you then move to selective screening of high-risk groups. But who do you target first?</em></p>\r\n<p>In the U.S. and Canada, systematic screening of all Baby Boomers is recommended – specifically everyone born between 1945 and 1965 in the U.S. and 1945 to 1975 in Canada.</p>\r\n<p>This demographic group is singled out because they are at significant risk of having been exposed to tainted blood through a transfusion, through the sharing of needles and unprotected sex. Because HCV infection often takes decades to have serious health impacts – like cirrhosis and liver cancer – this group is also most likely to suffer health impacts.</p>\r\n<p>Injection drug users and prisoners are also obvious targets for screening, as are blood donors who are rejected because they have one or more risk factors. But it cannot be forgotten that a significant proportion of HCV carriers – as many as one in four – have no obvious risk factors. Many countries are also adding hepatitis C to the current panel of screening tests done on pregnant women, in the hope they can prevent the virus from being passed on from mother-to-child.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7sKLcICED7Q?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It should be noted, however, that a number of countries, such as the Scandinavian nations, have made a decision to not screen for hepatitis C. Their reasoning is that the incidence of HCV - the number of new cases - has been close to zero for the past 20 years and that the rare cases found are usually imported, i.e. they would not be found by screening residents of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Testing is fraught with ethical questions.</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on present knowledge, roughly 70 per cent of those infected will probably not develop serious complications as a result of their infection. However, the test in itself cannot determine whether a patient will be among the 30 per cent who will develop a life-threatening liver disease. In addition, it is not known whether the 70/30 division will hold up over the long term. Only time will tell.</p>\r\n<p>Current treatment protocols call for offering treatment first to patients showing the effects of chronic HCV infection, because it is believed they are most likely to develop cirrhosis or liver cancer. But how do you reassure the other 70 per cent, the people who know they are infected but have no obvious illness? Will they be satisfied with simply being monitored, knowing they too could fall ill down the road?</p>\r\n<p><span style="color: #000000;">The key ethical question is whether you should actually test broadly if the resources do not exist to treat and care for everyone who has been identified as a carrier.</span></p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DmRaC6BsURc?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But it could also be argued that even if there is no promise of treatment, it would still be valuable to know whether you are infected. Because of the preventive steps you can take, like drinking less alcohol, and reducing the stress on the liver. Or being careful not to infect others (e.g., not sharing toothbrushes or razors with others, informing dentists and health care workers of infection status).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If treatment is unavailable, should people be informed that they are infected with a virus that could potentially cause cancer? Is it unethical to withhold that information?</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3QAP8fdq5X4?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Once identified, what next?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis C is a resource-intensive disease that many health systems will find hard to manage. A strong health system is required, and the ever-growing case load can potentially overwhelm even well-endowed systems.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_s6bDMbzmQ?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>One way low- and middle income countries have dealt with the crush burden of HIV/AIDS, has been to establish a parallel health system, caring only for patient with that condition. Could that approach, called “vertical programs,” also work for hepatitis C? And does this offering of specialized care strengthen or weaken the overall health system? The experience that countries in West Africa lived with the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak is that this approach may be counter-productive, leaving the rest of the system weak and vulnerable to new challenges. Ideally, investing in programs to treat diseases like HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C should be done in a manner that bolsters the system overall.</p>\r\n<p>The countries that do have a hepatitis policy usually have well-functioning health systems in place to build on, to integrate hepatitis into what already exists.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B1T4XcjX24c?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to note, however, that the expertise that has been built up in the HIV/AIDS programs could also be used to manage viral hepatitis, especially given the fact that the burden of HIV/AIDS is falling, and that of HCV is growing.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Do countries need a specific hepatitis policy?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It depends, as often is the case, on the local settings.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If the health system has the capacity and the resources to treat and follow a patient with chronic hepatitis like they would treat and follow up any other patient, then probably not.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If the health system does not have that capacity, then a plan, based on know-how from WHO‛s Global Hepatitis Program may be a good idea, because it will tell what to do and in which order. Also it can be a tool for accountability, to make sure things are being done.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The accumulated case load is again the obstacle. Dealing with a crisis usually comes at a cost, financial and managerial, somewhere else in the system. Most, maybe all, health systems don’t run with funds and personnel to spare. Budgets and resources are limited, even in the strongest, most developed and well-resourced health systems. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa, so overwhelmed Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, that even with foreign assistance, other serious health problems could not be addressed; maternal health, malaria, vaccinations, as well as many emergency rooms were severely affected. Even high income countries may run into problems caused by a surge in need for a particular treatment or test. After beginning to offer screening for colorectal cancers to all persons between the ages of 50-74 years, the healthcare system in Denmark witnessed an unexpected increase in waiting lists―so many more patients than anticipated needed follow-up colonoscopies that a number of hospital units could not keep up, despite having had years to prepare for the roll out of the screening program.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Other questions to ask:</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Doctors decide, based on guidelines, which patients receive treatment first.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How are patients told they are not yet eligible for treatment? How do ineligible patients feel?</em></li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>What do you do as a journalist when approached by an ineligible patient? Do you write their story, trying to make the doctor change his or her mind?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Current protocols for treating HIV-positive individuals recommend initiation of triple therapy as soon as infection is confirmed and not waiting several years for the immune system to be compromised.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Why then do HCV-positive individuals have to wait?</em></li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>The same question could be asked for statins that are readily given to prevent heart attacks and strokes.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;">5. <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Challenges around Treatment</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Drug Costs and Access to Treatment</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis C drugs are expensive – as much as $1,000 a pill. But they offer great promise – the real possibility of cure for many HCV carriers, and preventing a countless number of future infections.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">How drugs are priced, the profits they generate and the benefits they confer are the subject of much debate, and nowhere more so than when it comes to hepatitis C, because of the tremendous numbers of people infected.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some believe the price the pharmaceutical companies are asking for new drugs like Harvoni are based on what they can extract from governments and insurance companies rather than actual costs plus a reasonable return. Companies argue that the cost of research and development are astronomical and the drugs, while highly-priced, are a good investment because of the benefits to sufferers and the future HCV cases that will be prevented.</p>\r\n<p>In reality, we often don’t know the actual price paid, because list prices vary by country, and insurance plans, private and public, negotiate discounts.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CyomWClUeGk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>With HIV/AIDS drugs, these tiered pricing schemes, and agreements signed with generic companies have brought prices down markedly and made treatment available to millions.</p>\r\n<p>Will the same thing happen with hepatitis C drugs?</p>\r\n<p>We don’t know.</p>\r\n<p>What is known is that strong advocacy and the involvement of high-profile global health groups like The Global Fund, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Clinton Foundation created tremendous pressure to find solutions. Hepatitis C does not have that profile and the backing of people with star power – at least not yet.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wZVs9zImIBQ?feature=oembed&amp;start=2" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="340" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Who to treat and follow up?</em></p>\r\n<p>Current European and American guidelines do not recommend treating all those who test positive as soon as they are found. Most infected are asymptomatic for years and considered in no urgent need of treatment. Giving the medication too early may cause more harm than benefit.</p>\r\n<p>Based on the progression of disease, the physician will decide when to start the treatment. However, there is no universal agreement on when that time is.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ptks9wMhJXY?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment rids the body of the hepatitis C virus, but it does not eliminate or reverse liver disease. So the word “cure” is a bit misleading. Still, if the progression of disease can be halted, there should be less liver disease in the future, and that holds out the promise of drastically reducing the need for liver transplants, a very costly procedure. But reaping those savings in some distant future comes with a heavy price in the here and now. Today, health care systems are hit twice - they have to pay for the treatment as well as for liver transplants for those who have had chronic infection. To those already in need of a new liver the cure has come too late.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;<em>Will lowering the price of the drugs solve all problems? </em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Not necessarily. Of course it will make the drugs more accessible, but some of the bottlenecks in the system will remain, even if the drugs were available for free.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the first hurdles to overcome is having the drug registered within every country in which it is going to be used. The pharmaceutical company holding the rights to a product may not want to register it, because it will be too costly compared to what they can expect to earn. A generic manufacturer may also have concerns, because a generic drug has to be prequalified by the WHO, which is also costly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment involves testing, and tests have a price as well, not to mention that laboratories and trained personnel are required. Even in the industrialized countries trained personnel are in short supply. There are few physicians who specialize in liver disease, and taking on an extra caseload will be a challenge for them. Health systems do not have the excess capacity.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;<em>Questions worth asking:</em></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>Is there a limit to how many new, high priced drugs governments and insurance companies are willing to pay for?</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Will price be an (overruling) indicator for which patients will be given access to expensive drugs?</em></li>\r\n<li>Usually pharmaceutical companies use the argument of cost of research, clinical trials, approval, and drug candidates that turned out to be blind end, to justify prices. <em>But once those costs have been recuperated, will prices come down?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em>Developing stories to keep in mind:</em></p>\r\n<p>At the Millennium Summit at the United Nations in September 2000, world leaders committed to help achieve the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.

It can be caused by such things as bacteria, viruses, misuse of alcohol or toxins. Liver inflammation or damage can compromise liver function.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Acute Hepatitis </strong>C virus infection is a short-term illness that occurs within the first 6 months after someone is exposed to the Hepatitis C virus. For most people, acute infection leads to chronic infection.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chronic Hepatitis</strong> C virus infection is a long-term illness that occurs when the Hepatitis C virus remains in a person’s body. Hepatitis C virus infection can last a lifetime and lead to serious liver problems, including cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) or liver cancer.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This is because inflammation sustained over an extended period of time leads to liver damage, and repeated attempts to repair the tissue can result in the formation of scars of fibrous tissue.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Liver failure occurs When the liver cannot keep up with the body’s needs anymore, a condition that can be life-threatening and can be cured only by a liver transplant.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">2. <strong><a name="sec2"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Why is the liver so important ?

They are responsible for only 7% of the cases of viral hepatitis in the world.</p>\r\n<p>In some rare cases <strong>adenovirus</strong>, <strong>cytomegalovirus</strong> (CMV), <strong>Epstein-Barr virus</strong> (EBV), or <strong>herpes simplex virus</strong> (HSV) can also cause hepatitis.</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2041 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-1.jpg" alt="Table 1" height="2663" width="1894"></a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis D</strong> is caused by Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV). Because HDV needs the hepatitis B virus to replicate and survive in the body, it can only be found in people already infected with HBV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The HBV vaccine will therefore protect against both infections.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Like other hepatitis viruses, HDV is transmitted through contact with infected blood or blood products, semen, or other bodily fluids.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HDV infection of chronically infected HBV-carriers may lead to <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/hepatitis/whocdscsrncs20011/en/index7.html#fulminant">fulminant</a> acute hepatitis, a condition in which the liver produces a severe acute inflammatory response leading to extensive tissue damage and liver failure. It is 10 times more likely that fulminant acute hepatitis will develop in individuals co-infected with HDV and HBV than with other types of hepatitis viruses. It is also more likely for HDV/HDV co-infection to lead to severe chronic active hepatitis, increasing the risk of cirrhosis. Worldwide, more than 10 million people are infected with HDV, with a mortality rate between 2% and 20%, which is ten times higher than for hepatitis B alone.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis E</strong> is caused by Hepatitis E Virus, which infects about 20 million people in the world every year, leading to about 3 million cases of acute hepatitis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is transmitted mainly through contaminated drinking water worldwide, and is more common in East and South Asia. It usually resolves within 4–6 weeks, but in some cases can lead to a fulminant form of hepatitis, responsible for 56,600 deaths in the world every year.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The first vaccine to prevent hepatitis E virus infection has been produced and licensed in China, but is not yet available globally.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">5.<strong><a name="sec5"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How can different viral hepatitis be transmitted and how can transmission be prevented?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis A</strong> is transmitted through <strong>ingestion</strong> of microscopic amounts of fecal material, such as through contaminated food, drink, and objects.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis A transmission happens mainly by:</p>\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">eating fruits, vegetables, or other foods contaminated during handling</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">eating raw shellfish harvested from contaminated water</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">swallowing contaminated ice.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">These at-risk behaviours should be avoided to prevent transmission, particularly when travelling to countries that have a high or intermediate prevalence of the disease.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vaccination is t</strong>he most effective way to prevent Hepatitis A.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis B</strong> is transmitted by contact with infected blood, semen, or other <strong>body fluids</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis B transmission can therefore happen by:</p>\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">being born to an infected mother</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">having sexual intercourse with an infected person</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">sharing contaminated needles, syringes, or other injection drug equipment</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">being accidentally pricked by contaminated needlesticks or other sharp instruments (i.e healthcare professionals).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventative measures established for other blood and sexually transmitted diseases, both in healthcare and in everyday life, should be adopted to prevent Hepatitis B transmission.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Like Hepatitis A, the most effective way to prevent Hepatitis B is <strong>vaccination</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis C</strong> is spread through blood-to-blood contact. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water. Nor is it spread through casual contact, such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Infection can happen by:</p>\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n<li>sharing contaminated needles, syringes, or other injection drug equipment</li>\r\n<li>being accidentally pricked by contaminated needlesticks or other sharp instruments (i.e healthcare professionals)</li>\r\n<li>having received a blood transfusion or organ transplant before the early 1990s in developed countries — when widespread screening for HCV was introduced with increasing levels of efficacy at detecting the virus. In low resource countries, blood safety remains an issue of major concern.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Birth to an infected mother is a less common mode of transmission. According to US Centers for Disease prevention and Control (CDC), approximately 6% of infants born to infected mothers will get Hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV infection can only be prevented by avoiding blood-to-blood contacts.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventative measures should also include getting tattoes and piercings in certified facilities that use sterile instruments. Healthcare workers should follow professional preventative guidelines.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV cannot usually be transmitted sexually. Nevertheless, even if sexual transmission is very uncommon, practices involving blood contact should be considered <em>at risk</em> behaviors. Having a sexually transmitted disease or HIV, having sex with multiple partners, or engaging in rough sex appears to increase a person’s risk of getting Hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Sharing razors and toothbrushes can expose an individual to infection as well.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Still, about 1 out of 4 patients does not know how or when he or she was infected.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a><sup><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"></a></sup></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">People who have recovered from acute hepatitis C and those who have been cured must be careful about prevention, since reinfection is possible.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is as yet, no proven vaccine for HCV.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">6.<strong><a name="sec6"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Why don’t we have a vaccine for HCV?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A vaccine contains a biological agent that is usually an attenuated or replication-deficient version of a disease causing organism. Exposure to this agent will safely stimulate an individual’s immune system to acquire an immunity to the microorganism without causing disease. HCV is a difficult virus to produce a vaccine for because of its genetic diversity. As such, it is a challenge for scientists to find a target on the virus that is common across HCV genotypes and subgenotypes.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In contrast, HBV is easily recognized by the protein called Antigen Australia (HBsAg), and an immunological response against HbsAg can stop the infection, but researchers have not yet found such a promising target in the structure of HCV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The first vaccine for HCV to reach clinical trials was found to be safe and produced a good immune response in the 15 healthy human volunteers who took part in the phase 1 safety trial. Its efficacy is currently under investigation among intravenous drug users in two sites in the USA. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">7.<strong><a name="sec7"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Can blood transfusions still transmit HCV today?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In developed countries<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a>, the first blood test for HCV was introduced in 1990. This test could detect antibodies against HCV proteins. In the USA, screening blood from donors with this HCV test decreased the risk of transfusion-associated HCV infection per unit of blood from 0.36% (1 in 274) to 0.07% (1 in 3300). Today it is estimated that this test has prevented transmission of HCV to 40,000 patients per year in the US. This test wasn’t perfect. Antibodies to HCV weren’t detectable in the blood for at least 12 weeks after infection, and sometimes more than 26 weeks. During this window, tainted blood could therefore appear safe.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A second-generation more sensitive test, able to detect infected blood as early as 10-20 days post infection, was developed and approved in 1992 . It is estimated that this new test prevented an additional 13,000 people from becoming infected with HCV each year.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/history-of-postransfusion-hep.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2058 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/history-of-postransfusion-hep.jpg" alt="history of postransfusion hep" height="454" width="567"></a></span>Globally<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a>, blood transfusions are not yet as safe as they are in higher-income countries.

WHO estimates that the lack of effective screening results in up to 5 million new infections of hepatitis C every year in the world.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">8.<strong><a name="sec8"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are the challenges of HCV prevention in lower income countries?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The transmission of hepatitis C persists in most parts of Africa, as well as in other parts of the world, primarily because of traditional habits and a lack of resources in healthcare settings.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h3Z8DuJnwWM?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;9.<strong><a name="sec9"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are HCV genotypes, how many strains do we know and how common are they?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There are 7 main genotypes of Hepatitis C . These differences are based on major viral genetic characteristics, i.e. differences in the genetic sequence that may affect functional features of the virus and how it will respond to pharmacological treatments or antiviral drugs like interferon.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Other, more minor, variants can be found within each genotype; HCV is further classified into 67 confirmed and 20 provisional subtypes. The genetic differences between subtypes are more subtle, but these still need to be considered since these can sometimes influence the virus’s response to different kinds of treatments . In genotype 1, for example, the difference between genotype 1a and 1b is relevant in terms of anticipated treatment response and must therefore be assessed before initiating treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The high degree of genetic diversity of HCV continues to pose a significant challenge for achieving successful vaccines and drug therapies that are effective for all genotypes and subtypes, the so-called pan-genotypic treatment. Such an option would be of particular<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/most-common-genotypes.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-2062" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/most-common-genotypes-300x188.jpg" alt="most common genotypes" height="282" width="450"></a>interest in developing countries, where genotype testing is often unreliable or difficult to perform.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some current treatments are said to be pan-genotypic, but in the real world they have different degrees of effectiveness for different genotypes and are not approved for all of them (<em>see</em> treatment module). Doses, length of treatment, and rate of success still partly depend on HCV genotype, and sometimes subtype. Alternative drugs with broader efficacy are currently under investigation.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is possible for a person to be infected with more than one genotype.</p>\r\n<p class="alignleft" style="text-align: justify;">Globally, the most common genotype is G1 (42% of all HCV cases), followed by G3 (26%) and G4 (17%). The most common subtype is 1b (27%).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;Global distribution of different genotypes shows different prevalence in different areas of the world.</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence-map_genotypes.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2063 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence-map_genotypes.jpg" alt="prevalence map_genotypes" height="404" width="950"></a><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Map taken from Messina et al, 2014 (Fig 1A)</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;Genotype 1 (subtype 1b), is the most prevalent genotype in higher income countries, followed by genotype 3.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The global distribution of HCV genetic variation could be related to historical and contemporary trends in human migration. For example, strains from West Africa (genotype 2) could have been brought to the Americas through the trans-Atlantic slave trade.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One possible explanation for the global distribution of genotype 1 is its association with the most common cause of HCV infection in the 20th century — the distribution of contaminated blood and blood products before HCV screening of blood began. In fact, genotype 1 is prevalent in developed countries, where blood transfusions were more available and widespread: a hypothesis is that the most common sources of blood in those years were from areas where this genotype was prevalent.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The global dissemination of genotype 3 is more likely to be attributed to the association of subtype 3a with injection drug use and to population migration in United Kingdom during colonialism from countries where subtype 3a is dominant, such as India and Pakistan.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if genotype 1 and 3 infections are more prevalent than all other genotypes globally. Genotypes found more commonly in lower-income countries still account for a significant proportion of HCV cases worldwide. Specifically, genotype 2 is most frequent in West Africa and parts of South America (the latter likely reflecting population movements resulting from the trans-Atlantic slave trade), while genotypes 4 and 6 are common in Central/North Africa and East/Southeast Asia, respectively.</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/be-aware-box_1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2070 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/be-aware-box_1.jpg" alt="be aware box_1" height="378" width="1205"></a></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">10.<strong><a name="sec10"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are the symptoms of hepatitis C?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Most people with hepatitis C do not have symptoms and do not know they are infected until their liver has sustained significant damage.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A chronic viral hepatitis infection can present without any symptoms for decades.<br>\r\nHowever, it is possible to experience the following symptoms:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>feeling unusually tired all the time</li>\r\n<li>depression</li>\r\n<li>jaundice</li>\r\n<li>a general sense of feeling unwell</li>\r\n<li>abdominal pain or bloating</li>\r\n<li>loss of memory</li>\r\n<li>itchy skin</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Since these symptoms are very vague, and similar to those reported in many other common diseases, people are often unaware of their condition until they develop cirrhosis, when scar tissue replaces healthy tissue in the liver and prevents the liver from working properly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The early stages of cirrhosis can be as insidious as the previous phases, with very few or no symptoms experienced by the individual, but as the liver loses its ability to function properly, a loss of appetite, nausea and itchy skin become more and more common.<br>\r\nAs the disease progresses, and liver functions are affected, many new symptoms tend to develop:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">weight loss and muscle wasting</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">tenderness or pain around the liver area</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">blood capillaries on the skin above waist level</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">a tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequent nosebleeds or bleeding gums</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">hair loss</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">fever and shivering attacks</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">swelling in the legs, ankles and feet due to a build-up of fluid (edema)</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">swelling in abdomen, due to a build-up of fluid known as ascites</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Changes in personality, insomnia, memory loss, confusion and difficulty concentrating are caused by an encephalopathy that can occur when toxins affect the brain, because the liver is unable to remove them from the body.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">11.<span style="color: #3366ff;">How often does the disease progress into a chronic infection and what happens to the liver?</span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the WHO, at least 15% of infected persons spontaneously clear the virus within 6 months of infection, without any treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The remaining 55–85% of persons will develop a chronic HCV infection. When chronic Hepatitis C develops, it can result in long-term health problems, including liver damage, liver failure, liver cancer, and even death.<br>\r\nOf those with chronic HCV infection, the risk of cirrhosis of the liver is 15–30% within 20 years.<br>\r\nChronic hepatitis C is the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer and the most common reason for liver transplantation in the United States.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">For every 100 persons infected with HCV, approximately 1–5 will die from the consequences of chronic infection (liver cancer or cirrhosis) (source CDC).</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/z_liver-damage_timeline_1-flat-small.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2036 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/z_liver-damage_timeline_1-flat-small.jpg" alt="liver damage_timeline_final" height="1751" width="2508"></a></p>\r\n<p>based on http://www.hepatitisc.uw.edu/go/evaluation-staging-monitoring/natural-history/core-concept/all</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCyoHQ-KKaw?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;12.<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">How can Hepatitis C be diagnosed?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In most cases infection is identified when the patient is screened for blood donation or when elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT, a liver enzyme) levels are detected during routine medical exams.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When HCV infection is suspected, a blood test is performed to search for antibodies against HCV. If the test detects the presence of antibodies, a second test is performed to directly establish whether the virus itself is currently present in the individual.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/org-chart_good-one2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2279 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/org-chart_good-one2.jpg" alt="org chart_good one2" height="2750" width="907"></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">...</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9S1ycVi9gA?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C is based on the detection of both anti-HCV antibodies and direct detection of the HCV virus in the presence of biological (i.e. abnormal levels of liver enzymes in blood tests) or histological (that can be seen examining small parts of liver tissue taken by biopsy) signs of chronic hepatitis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Having anti-HCV antibodies (anti-HCV positive) in blood does not necessarily mean that an individual has an active hepatitis C infection. The presence of antibodies is an indication that a person has at some point in the past mounted an immune response againt HCV. Approximately 20% of the infected people clear the virus within 6 months, and these individuals will continue to carry antibodies againt HCV. Anti-HCV-positive, HCV RNA negative individuals should be retested for HCV RNA three months later to confirm true convalescence. After that, they are not considered to have hepatitis C. Although no longer infected, they will still test positive for anti-HCV antibodies all their lives. Since they don’t host the virus in their blood, they cannot spread the disease.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the presence of both anti-HCV antibodies and the HCV virus in blood indicates the presence of a hepatitis C infection and, consequently, that the person is infectious. If the direct HCV test is negative within 6 months, the patient had acute hepatitis C. If the test continues to yield positive results beyond 6 months, the patient is diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">After that time, it is very rare for the immune system to clear the virus and for the test to be negative.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, HCV antibodies are not protective against reinfection, which can occur after successful treatment as well (See <em>Treatment</em> module for more information).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2283 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2.jpg" alt="Table 2" height="556" width="2033"></a>A laboratory test for identifying the genotype (and 1a/1b subtype) of the hepatitis C strain and an assessment of liver damage will guide treatment choices.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Establishing the amount of virus present, or the “viral load” can also help predict a treatment’s success.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A test of the patient’s DNA can help determine how effective certain drugs can be against HCV. Variants of a gene involved in the immune response against HCV (Interleukin 28B, IL28B), can alter the effect of certain HCV treatments (See Treatment module).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">13.<span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff;" name="sec13"></a>How can liver damage be assessed?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main factors influencing the type and timing of treatment is the severity of liver disease.<br>\r\nPatients with cirrhosis have to be identified since their treatment regimen needs to be adapted accordingly. The fibrosis stage can be assessed initially with imaging (ultrasound scan, MRI,…), liver stiffness measurement, and identification of biomarkers in the blood.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Liver stiffness measurement (FibroScan®) measures how quickly vibrations pass through the liver. The more ‘stiff’ or damaged the liver is, the more quickly the waves will pass through it .</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Blood biomarkers include several direct markers which correlate with, or are part of, the liver matrix that is produced in the fibrosis process. Other indirect markers reflect changes in liver function. They are molecules released into the blood when there is inflammation of the liver.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Both stiffness measurement and biomarkers can distinguish quite well between cirrhosis and no-fibrosis. Combined, these tests can identify intermediate degrees of fibrosis. These tests reduce the need for an invasive liver biopsy, a procedure that can be problematic for patients with impaired blood clotting capacity.<br>\r\nIn patients without compromised blood clotting, there is little risk of hemorrage from a liver biopsy, since it involves taking a small tissue sample from the liver though the skin by percutaneous core needle, under ultrasound guide. This tissue sample is then examined under a microscope.</p>\r\n<p>14.<strong><a name="sec14"></a> How is Hepatitis C treated and managed?</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When a diagnosis of Hepatitis C is confirmed, the presence or absence of other diseases must be established since this can influence prognosis and treatment. Mycotoxins, as well as alcohol, can make the evolution of the disease more severe. A concurrent infection with HIV, for example, can require a different approach with different drugs, and possible drug interactions must also be considered.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The degree of liver damage and virus genotype are used to drive treatment and management of the disease (see treatment module).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A therapy’s success is evaluated by blood tests showing no detectable virus. A sustained virus response (SVR), is the continued absence of detectable HCV virus in the blood six months (24 weeks) after the end of treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The antiviral Interferon-α was the the first drug treatment for HCV after it was discovered in 1989. In 2011, a more persistent form of interferon-α (Pegylated interferon- α), together with the antiviral drug ribavirin, increased the rates of success. These, however, never exceeded a 50% cure rate, and their heavy side effects often forced patients to discontinue the treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2011, new antivirals called Direct Agent Antivirals (DAA, i.e. protease inhibitors acting directly on the virus instead of on the patient) were introduced, to be given in association with previous drugs (triple therapy regimen). They improved the SVR in up to 75% of patients, but with even worse side effects.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All these therapies were more effective on other genotypes than on genotype 1, the most common in higher income countries. Substantial research efforts led to a new class of DAA. The first to be introduced was sofosbuvir in 2014. The new therapies are even more effective on genotype 1 than on others, approaching 95% of success rates in clinical trials with fewer and milder side effects.<br>\r\nNow, the real challenge is providing access to these revolutionary drugs (please refer to Treatment section for success rates of the DAA in other genotypes). They are very expensive and on a global scale most healthcare systems and patients cannot afford them.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This has made hepatitis C therapy more a policy issue than a medical one.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9S1ycVi9gA?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>REFERENCES</strong></p>\r\n<p>Prati, D.

Doctors have known about HCV – or, as it was long known, non-A non-B hepatitis - for years, but it was believed to be less problematic than its better known viral cousins, hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Besides, there were other, more formidable, infectious disease challenges that came along, like AIDS, that pre-occupied public health officials and politicians. But quietly, over time, scientific knowledge of hepatitis C grew and, along with it, the sobering realization that it is one of the world’s biggest killers, claiming as many lives as hepatitis B, and even more than malaria.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But, unlike other forms of viral hepatitis, there are effective treatments for HCV, and that means many of the estimated 700,000 deaths the disease claims annually are preventable – at least in theory. These treatments come at a high price and good data are lacking on how many are truly infected on a global scale, and who would benefit most from treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Medicine, however, is only part of the story. HCV is a political and public health challenge on a global scale and, to come to grips with it, we must address many questions:</p>\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">How HCV has become a public health crisis.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">What is the best public health response to the epidemic?</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">Who should be screened, and how?</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">The challenges around treatment beyond cost.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This section will focus on these issues and more, providing fodder for inquisitive journalists.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2.<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"> The Unseen Epidemic: events behind the HCV crisis</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The role of public health is to protect and improve the health of the population, not just individuals. Prevention and health promotion initiatives help routine challenges, such as the spread of infectious diseases, from developing into crises. However, public health officials rarely have the final say on priority-setting, adoption of specific strategies, or how much money will be allocated to the response. That belongs to politicians, and they may accept, ignore, or even go against expert advice, for a host of economic or political reasons.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">How to respond to hepatitis C proved to be a major challenge for public health experts and policy-makers. At first, they had little solid information to guide their response. While scientists had known since the mid-70s that there was a variant of hepatitis that was neither A nor B, they could not pinpoint it. There was no test to detect it and no vaccine to prevent it. They also assumed, quite reasonably that the virus was not that big of a deal because few people fell acutely ill. They would realize only later that the virus gnawed away slowly at the liver and caused grave conditions like liver cancer and cirrhosis decades later.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV was finally given a proper name in 1989, when the virus was discovered. Soon after, an antibody test was developed to screen blood for the virus, and public health officials and regulators began the process of creating blood screening strategies. It was believed that this would help contain the spread of the virus. However, at the time, whether this was necessary was a matter of debate. HCV was seen as a small-scale problem, causing only minor manifestations in relatively few patients, many of whom were believed to clear the infection after the initial symptoms. No one knew HCV caused chronic infections or that carriers of the virus were able to infect others even when they had no obvious signs of illness.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZouPfK_E2j0?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As the global impact of HCV has become apparent, the World Health Assembly - WHO’s governing body - has adopted a number of resolutions. In 2011, July 28 was officially recognized as World Hepatitis Day - to create awareness, strengthen prevention and coordinate a global response. A Global Hepatitis Program has also been set up within the WHO to set standards and issue guidelines to help countries formulate specific hepatitis policies for prevention and treatment.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-lyEJQYBnDM?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Hepatitis C had little profile as a public health issue because was it was thought to be a problem mainly confined to intravenous drug users.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ywPfw-vhEM?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;As screening increased, it was discovered that out of the approximately 150 million individuals living with chronic hepatitis C only some 10 million got it through injection drug use. The vast majority contracted the virus via contact with the health system, through blood transfusions, unsafe injections and other health care exposures with poor infection control practices.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4i2tHXkX_lE?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>Another factor contributing to the crisis might possibly be doctors themselves.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qT_B_pb0XTo?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2>&nbsp;<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">3.</span> P for Public Health: Protection - Prevention - Promotion - Prognosis - Provision</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The role of public health</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Public Health tools for handling HCV could include:</p>\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n<li><strong>Surveillance and patient screening</strong>:<br>\r\nmonitoring national prevalence (number of total cases) and incidence (number of new cases in a given period of time) of the virus, identifying asymptomatic chronic carriers, following these patients to determine when to provide treatment and making sure they adhere to the prescribed regimen</li>\r\n<li><strong>Education:</strong><br>\r\ndisseminating information to the public and health professionals about the disease, risk factors, how to avoid infection, etc. on a regular basis and with a special effort on national and community level to mark World Hepatitis Day on July 28<br>\r\ninitiating health education and training to reduce risk of transmission during exposures in nonmedical (e.g., commercial barbering, body piercing, tattoos, and traditional circumcision) and occupational (e.g., health care and sanitation worker) settings.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Testing Blood products</strong>:<br>\r\ntesting all blood used for transfusions and blood products<br>\r\nvirus inactivation (heat-treatment) of plasma-derived products<br>\r\nencouraging the use of as little transfusion blood as possible</li>\r\n<li><strong>Infection-Control</strong>:<br>\r\nenforcing infection control practices<br>\r\nencouraging the use of therapeutic syringes with features to prevent reuse and injuries as well as safe handling and disposal of sharps and waste<br>\r\nencouraging adequate sterilization of reusable material such as surgical or dental instruments</li>\r\n<li><strong>Counseling:</strong><br>\r\npeople with chronic, asymptomatic HCV<br>\r\nincluding teaching them not to share toothbrushes and razors with others and to let their dentist and other medical workers know of their infection status, giving these individuals the opportunity to protect themselves appropriately</li>\r\n<li><strong>Harm Reduction</strong>:<br>\r\ninitiating harm reduction programs, with counseling, needle-syringe exchange and opiate substitution therapy for injection drug users</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However resources are limited, and as a result, political prioritization guides public health decisions. Public health may make recommendations, but whether or not these recommendations will be acted upon is something that will be determined at the political level. Therefore it is important to understand that there is public health and there are politics and these are not always aligned.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>This is also fertile ground for journalism</em>: to document and explore the discrepancies between promises and action.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventing the spread of HCV does not require reinventing the wheel. Many of these strategies are already used to prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS: the screening of donor blood and blood products, universal infection control practices, education, and harm reduction. A number of the steps that have been used against HIV/AIDS likely helped curb the spread of HCV because they have similar routes of transmission and there is some co-infection.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, HCV can stay active outside the human body much longer than HIV. Consequently, infection control practices (e.g., hand-washing, sterilization of reusable medical equipment, and cleaning of surfaces) have to be even stricter for HCV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All the HIV/AIDS prevention efforts never managed to curtail one significant contributor to the spread of blood-borne infections in low- and middle-income countries: unnecessary injections. In Egypt, where there is a generalized HCV epidemic, the prevalence is highest in people with ongoing or a past history of medical injections. It will require determined education efforts to change the practice of re-using needles for vaccinations and other procedures.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, what is needed most fundamentally to prevent the spread of infectious diseases like hepatitis C is a well-functioning and well-staffed healthcare system – something that does not exist in many countries - along with political will, a willingness to invest in safer healthcare.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YV2zVQC5-z0?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Many countries have only applied a few of the public health tools against HCV. Is that an option?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As most chronic patients are asymptomatic it might seem easy to ignore the disease, but there can be serious impacts on a community or a country’s health care resources. If a large group of individuals begins to exhibit liver disease within the same time frame, as expected in this case, then governments will indeed be faced with an acute problem. What course of action politicians decide to take determines the outcome of this public health issue.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of instituting sound health policies can slow their adoption. For example, when a blood test for HCV became available in the early 1990s, some countries were slow to incorporate it as part of the regular screening of blood in hospitals as they had already spent a considerable amount in the 1980s to set up screening for HIV/AIDS.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Even before HCV was identified in 1989 it was known that a non-A, non-B hepatitis was circulating in the blood supply. It is estimated that in the 1970s in the U.S., the risk of contracting hepatitis from blood-transfusion was as high as 30 per cent. Thanks to screening of donor blood, that risk dropped to almost zero by the year 2000.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WsB0L7KqU18?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Questions worth asking:</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Overuse of (unnecessary) injections with unsterile equipment seems to be a driver in spreading the virus, seen not only in Egypt, but in many low- and middle-income countries.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Can education counter the popular belief that injections works against most everything?</em></li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to make sure that the needle being used in a medical procedure was sterile?</em></li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to make sure that the needle being used for an injection in a market stall was sterile?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A key question that was asked in country after country with regard to tainted blood and HIV/AIDS could also be applied to HCV:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Did public health do enough and in time to curb the spread of non-A, non-B hepatitis? Or did they opt to do nothing to save money?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2>&nbsp;4. <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">The unknowingly infected</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Screening Strategies: How to find those who are infected and do not know it?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>A large number of people infected with HCV are ‛silent carriers‛ - meaning they show no symptoms for years, even decades. How can they be identified? And should they be identified if the resources </em><em>treat them are lacking</em><em>? </em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Universal screening – testing everyone systematically for HCV – is one approach, at least in theory. But, in most countries that is not practical, nor fiscally responsible, given all the other health priorities. Besides, a screening test only confirms past exposure to the virus. That would need to be followed up with other more costly tests that 1) confirm the continued presence of the virus circulating in the blood, and in what amounts, and 2) determine the degree damage to the liver. It is a cascade of testing that can quickly become very costly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ideally, what researchers would like to see is a single, inexpensive blood or serology test that provides all the relevant information. But a test like that is currently only a dream.</p>\r\n<p><em>If you rule out universal screening, you then move to selective screening of high-risk groups. But who do you target first?</em></p>\r\n<p>In the U.S. and Canada, systematic screening of all Baby Boomers is recommended – specifically everyone born between 1945 and 1965 in the U.S. and 1945 to 1975 in Canada.</p>\r\n<p>This demographic group is singled out because they are at significant risk of having been exposed to tainted blood through a transfusion, through the sharing of needles and unprotected sex. Because HCV infection often takes decades to have serious health impacts – like cirrhosis and liver cancer – this group is also most likely to suffer health impacts.</p>\r\n<p>Injection drug users and prisoners are also obvious targets for screening, as are blood donors who are rejected because they have one or more risk factors. But it cannot be forgotten that a significant proportion of HCV carriers – as many as one in four – have no obvious risk factors. Many countries are also adding hepatitis C to the current panel of screening tests done on pregnant women, in the hope they can prevent the virus from being passed on from mother-to-child.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7sKLcICED7Q?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It should be noted, however, that a number of countries, such as the Scandinavian nations, have made a decision to not screen for hepatitis C. Their reasoning is that the incidence of HCV - the number of new cases - has been close to zero for the past 20 years and that the rare cases found are usually imported, i.e. they would not be found by screening residents of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Testing is fraught with ethical questions.</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on present knowledge, roughly 70 per cent of those infected will probably not develop serious complications as a result of their infection. However, the test in itself cannot determine whether a patient will be among the 30 per cent who will develop a life-threatening liver disease. In addition, it is not known whether the 70/30 division will hold up over the long term. Only time will tell.</p>\r\n<p>Current treatment protocols call for offering treatment first to patients showing the effects of chronic HCV infection, because it is believed they are most likely to develop cirrhosis or liver cancer. But how do you reassure the other 70 per cent, the people who know they are infected but have no obvious illness? Will they be satisfied with simply being monitored, knowing they too could fall ill down the road?</p>\r\n<p><span style="color: #000000;">The key ethical question is whether you should actually test broadly if the resources do not exist to treat and care for everyone who has been identified as a carrier.</span></p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DmRaC6BsURc?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But it could also be argued that even if there is no promise of treatment, it would still be valuable to know whether you are infected. Because of the preventive steps you can take, like drinking less alcohol, and reducing the stress on the liver. Or being careful not to infect others (e.g., not sharing toothbrushes or razors with others, informing dentists and health care workers of infection status).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If treatment is unavailable, should people be informed that they are infected with a virus that could potentially cause cancer? Is it unethical to withhold that information?</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3QAP8fdq5X4?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Once identified, what next?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis C is a resource-intensive disease that many health systems will find hard to manage. A strong health system is required, and the ever-growing case load can potentially overwhelm even well-endowed systems.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_s6bDMbzmQ?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>One way low- and middle income countries have dealt with the crush burden of HIV/AIDS, has been to establish a parallel health system, caring only for patient with that condition. Could that approach, called “vertical programs,” also work for hepatitis C? And does this offering of specialized care strengthen or weaken the overall health system? The experience that countries in West Africa lived with the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak is that this approach may be counter-productive, leaving the rest of the system weak and vulnerable to new challenges. Ideally, investing in programs to treat diseases like HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C should be done in a manner that bolsters the system overall.</p>\r\n<p>The countries that do have a hepatitis policy usually have well-functioning health systems in place to build on, to integrate hepatitis into what already exists.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B1T4XcjX24c?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to note, however, that the expertise that has been built up in the HIV/AIDS programs could also be used to manage viral hepatitis, especially given the fact that the burden of HIV/AIDS is falling, and that of HCV is growing.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Do countries need a specific hepatitis policy?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It depends, as often is the case, on the local settings.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If the health system has the capacity and the resources to treat and follow a patient with chronic hepatitis like they would treat and follow up any other patient, then probably not.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If the health system does not have that capacity, then a plan, based on know-how from WHO‛s Global Hepatitis Program may be a good idea, because it will tell what to do and in which order. Also it can be a tool for accountability, to make sure things are being done.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The accumulated case load is again the obstacle. Dealing with a crisis usually comes at a cost, financial and managerial, somewhere else in the system. Most, maybe all, health systems don’t run with funds and personnel to spare. Budgets and resources are limited, even in the strongest, most developed and well-resourced health systems. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa, so overwhelmed Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, that even with foreign assistance, other serious health problems could not be addressed; maternal health, malaria, vaccinations, as well as many emergency rooms were severely affected. Even high income countries may run into problems caused by a surge in need for a particular treatment or test. After beginning to offer screening for colorectal cancers to all persons between the ages of 50-74 years, the healthcare system in Denmark witnessed an unexpected increase in waiting lists―so many more patients than anticipated needed follow-up colonoscopies that a number of hospital units could not keep up, despite having had years to prepare for the roll out of the screening program.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Other questions to ask:</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Doctors decide, based on guidelines, which patients receive treatment first.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How are patients told they are not yet eligible for treatment? How do ineligible patients feel?</em></li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>What do you do as a journalist when approached by an ineligible patient? Do you write their story, trying to make the doctor change his or her mind?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Current protocols for treating HIV-positive individuals recommend initiation of triple therapy as soon as infection is confirmed and not waiting several years for the immune system to be compromised.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Why then do HCV-positive individuals have to wait?</em></li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>The same question could be asked for statins that are readily given to prevent heart attacks and strokes.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;">5. <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Challenges around Treatment</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Drug Costs and Access to Treatment</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis C drugs are expensive – as much as $1,000 a pill. But they offer great promise – the real possibility of cure for many HCV carriers, and preventing a countless number of future infections.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">How drugs are priced, the profits they generate and the benefits they confer are the subject of much debate, and nowhere more so than when it comes to hepatitis C, because of the tremendous numbers of people infected.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some believe the price the pharmaceutical companies are asking for new drugs like Harvoni are based on what they can extract from governments and insurance companies rather than actual costs plus a reasonable return. Companies argue that the cost of research and development are astronomical and the drugs, while highly-priced, are a good investment because of the benefits to sufferers and the future HCV cases that will be prevented.</p>\r\n<p>In reality, we often don’t know the actual price paid, because list prices vary by country, and insurance plans, private and public, negotiate discounts.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CyomWClUeGk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>With HIV/AIDS drugs, these tiered pricing schemes, and agreements signed with generic companies have brought prices down markedly and made treatment available to millions.</p>\r\n<p>Will the same thing happen with hepatitis C drugs?</p>\r\n<p>We don’t know.</p>\r\n<p>What is known is that strong advocacy and the involvement of high-profile global health groups like The Global Fund, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Clinton Foundation created tremendous pressure to find solutions. Hepatitis C does not have that profile and the backing of people with star power – at least not yet.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wZVs9zImIBQ?feature=oembed&amp;start=2" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="340" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Who to treat and follow up?</em></p>\r\n<p>Current European and American guidelines do not recommend treating all those who test positive as soon as they are found. Most infected are asymptomatic for years and considered in no urgent need of treatment. Giving the medication too early may cause more harm than benefit.</p>\r\n<p>Based on the progression of disease, the physician will decide when to start the treatment. However, there is no universal agreement on when that time is.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ptks9wMhJXY?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment rids the body of the hepatitis C virus, but it does not eliminate or reverse liver disease. So the word “cure” is a bit misleading. Still, if the progression of disease can be halted, there should be less liver disease in the future, and that holds out the promise of drastically reducing the need for liver transplants, a very costly procedure. But reaping those savings in some distant future comes with a heavy price in the here and now. Today, health care systems are hit twice - they have to pay for the treatment as well as for liver transplants for those who have had chronic infection. To those already in need of a new liver the cure has come too late.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;<em>Will lowering the price of the drugs solve all problems? </em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Not necessarily. Of course it will make the drugs more accessible, but some of the bottlenecks in the system will remain, even if the drugs were available for free.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the first hurdles to overcome is having the drug registered within every country in which it is going to be used. The pharmaceutical company holding the rights to a product may not want to register it, because it will be too costly compared to what they can expect to earn. A generic manufacturer may also have concerns, because a generic drug has to be prequalified by the WHO, which is also costly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment involves testing, and tests have a price as well, not to mention that laboratories and trained personnel are required. Even in the industrialized countries trained personnel are in short supply. There are few physicians who specialize in liver disease, and taking on an extra caseload will be a challenge for them. Health systems do not have the excess capacity.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;<em>Questions worth asking:</em></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>Is there a limit to how many new, high priced drugs governments and insurance companies are willing to pay for?</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Will price be an (overruling) indicator for which patients will be given access to expensive drugs?</em></li>\r\n<li>Usually pharmaceutical companies use the argument of cost of research, clinical trials, approval, and drug candidates that turned out to be blind end, to justify prices. <em>But once those costs have been recuperated, will prices come down?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em>Developing stories to keep in mind:</em></p>\r\n<p>At the Millennium Summit at the United Nations in September 2000, world leaders committed to help achieve the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.

Doctors have known about HCV – or, as it was long known, non-A non-B hepatitis - for years, but it was believed to be less problematic than its better known viral cousins, hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Besides, there were other, more formidable, infectious disease challenges that came along, like AIDS, that pre-occupied public health officials and politicians. But quietly, over time, scientific knowledge of hepatitis C grew and, along with it, the sobering realization that it is one of the world’s biggest killers, claiming as many lives as hepatitis B, and even more than malaria.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But, unlike other forms of viral hepatitis, there are effective treatments for HCV, and that means many of the estimated 700,000 deaths the disease claims annually are preventable – at least in theory. These treatments come at a high price and good data are lacking on how many are truly infected on a global scale, and who would benefit most from treatment.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Medicine, however, is only part of the story. HCV is a political and public health challenge on a global scale and, to come to grips with it, we must address many questions:</p>\n\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">How HCV has become a public health crisis.</li>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">What is the best public health response to the epidemic?</li>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Who should be screened, and how?</li>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">The challenges around treatment beyond cost.</li>\n</ul>\nThis section will focus on these issues and more, providing fodder for inquisitive journalists.\n\n<hr />\n\n<a name="sec2"></a>\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2.<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"> The Unseen Epidemic: events behind the HCV crisis</span></strong></h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The role of public health is to protect and improve the health of the population, not just individuals. Prevention and health promotion initiatives help routine challenges, such as the spread of infectious diseases, from developing into crises. However, public health officials rarely have the final say on priority-setting, adoption of specific strategies, or how much money will be allocated to the response. That belongs to politicians, and they may accept, ignore, or even go against expert advice, for a host of economic or political reasons.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">How to respond to hepatitis C proved to be a major challenge for public health experts and policy-makers. At first, they had little solid information to guide their response. While scientists had known since the mid-70s that there was a variant of hepatitis that was neither A nor B, they could not pinpoint it. There was no test to detect it and no vaccine to prevent it. They also assumed, quite reasonably that the virus was not that big of a deal because few people fell acutely ill. They would realize only later that the virus gnawed away slowly at the liver and caused grave conditions like liver cancer and cirrhosis decades later.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV was finally given a proper name in 1989, when the virus was discovered. Soon after, an antibody test was developed to screen blood for the virus, and public health officials and regulators began the process of creating blood screening strategies. It was believed that this would help contain the spread of the virus. However, at the time, whether this was necessary was a matter of debate. HCV was seen as a small-scale problem, causing only minor manifestations in relatively few patients, many of whom were believed to clear the infection after the initial symptoms. No one knew HCV caused chronic infections or that carriers of the virus were able to infect others even when they had no obvious signs of illness.</p>\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZouPfK_E2j0?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As the global impact of HCV has become apparent, the World Health Assembly - WHO’s governing body - has adopted a number of resolutions. In 2011, July 28 was officially recognized as World Hepatitis Day - to create awareness, strengthen prevention and coordinate a global response. A Global Hepatitis Program has also been set up within the WHO to set standards and issue guidelines to help countries formulate specific hepatitis policies for prevention and treatment.</p>\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-lyEJQYBnDM?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHepatitis C had little profile as a public health issue because was it was thought to be a problem mainly confined to intravenous drug users.\n\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ywPfw-vhEM?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> As screening increased, it was discovered that out of the approximately 150 million individuals living with chronic hepatitis C only some 10 million got it through injection drug use. The vast majority contracted the virus via contact with the health system, through blood transfusions, unsafe injections and other health care exposures with poor infection control practices.</p>\n <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4i2tHXkX_lE?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\n\nAnother factor contributing to the crisis might possibly be doctors themselves.\n\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qT_B_pb0XTo?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\n\n<hr />\n\n<a name="sec3"></a>\n<h2 name="sec3"> <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">3.</span> P for Public Health: Protection - Prevention - Promotion - Prognosis - Provision</span></strong></h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The role of public health</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Public Health tools for handling HCV could include:</p>\n\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\n	<li><strong>Surveillance and patient screening</strong>:\nmonitoring national prevalence (number of total cases) and incidence (number of new cases in a given period of time) of the virus, identifying asymptomatic chronic carriers, following these patients to determine when to provide treatment and making sure they adhere to the prescribed regimen</li>\n	<li><strong>Education:</strong>\ndisseminating information to the public and health professionals about the disease, risk factors, how to avoid infection, etc. on a regular basis and with a special effort on national and community level to mark World Hepatitis Day on July 28\ninitiating health education and training to reduce risk of transmission during exposures in nonmedical (e.g., commercial barbering, body piercing, tattoos, and traditional circumcision) and occupational (e.g., health care and sanitation worker) settings.</li>\n	<li><strong>Testing Blood products</strong>:\ntesting all blood used for transfusions and blood products\nvirus inactivation (heat-treatment) of plasma-derived products\nencouraging the use of as little transfusion blood as possible</li>\n	<li><strong>Infection-Control</strong>:\nenforcing infection control practices\nencouraging the use of therapeutic syringes with features to prevent reuse and injuries as well as safe handling and disposal of sharps and waste\nencouraging adequate sterilization of reusable material such as surgical or dental instruments</li>\n	<li><strong>Counseling:</strong>\npeople with chronic, asymptomatic HCV\nincluding teaching them not to share toothbrushes and razors with others and to let their dentist and other medical workers know of their infection status, giving these individuals the opportunity to protect themselves appropriately</li>\n	<li><strong>Harm Reduction</strong>:\ninitiating harm reduction programs, with counseling, needle-syringe exchange and opiate substitution therapy for injection drug users</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However resources are limited, and as a result, political prioritization guides public health decisions. Public health may make recommendations, but whether or not these recommendations will be acted upon is something that will be determined at the political level. Therefore it is important to understand that there is public health and there are politics and these are not always aligned.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>This is also fertile ground for journalism</em>: to document and explore the discrepancies between promises and action.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventing the spread of HCV does not require reinventing the wheel. Many of these strategies are already used to prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS: the screening of donor blood and blood products, universal infection control practices, education, and harm reduction. A number of the steps that have been used against HIV/AIDS likely helped curb the spread of HCV because they have similar routes of transmission and there is some co-infection.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, HCV can stay active outside the human body much longer than HIV. Consequently, infection control practices (e.g., hand-washing, sterilization of reusable medical equipment, and cleaning of surfaces) have to be even stricter for HCV.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All the HIV/AIDS prevention efforts never managed to curtail one significant contributor to the spread of blood-borne infections in low- and middle-income countries: unnecessary injections. In Egypt, where there is a generalized HCV epidemic, the prevalence is highest in people with ongoing or a past history of medical injections. It will require determined education efforts to change the practice of re-using needles for vaccinations and other procedures.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, what is needed most fundamentally to prevent the spread of infectious diseases like hepatitis C is a well-functioning and well-staffed healthcare system – something that does not exist in many countries - along with political will, a willingness to invest in safer healthcare.</p>\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YV2zVQC5-z0?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Many countries have only applied a few of the public health tools against HCV. Is that an option?</em></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As most chronic patients are asymptomatic it might seem easy to ignore the disease, but there can be serious impacts on a community or a country’s health care resources. If a large group of individuals begins to exhibit liver disease within the same time frame, as expected in this case, then governments will indeed be faced with an acute problem. What course of action politicians decide to take determines the outcome of this public health issue.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of instituting sound health policies can slow their adoption. For example, when a blood test for HCV became available in the early 1990s, some countries were slow to incorporate it as part of the regular screening of blood in hospitals as they had already spent a considerable amount in the 1980s to set up screening for HIV/AIDS.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Even before HCV was identified in 1989 it was known that a non-A, non-B hepatitis was circulating in the blood supply. It is estimated that in the 1970s in the U.S., the risk of contracting hepatitis from blood-transfusion was as high as 30 per cent. Thanks to screening of donor blood, that risk dropped to almost zero by the year 2000.</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WsB0L7KqU18?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\n\n&nbsp;\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Questions worth asking:</em></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Overuse of (unnecessary) injections with unsterile equipment seems to be a driver in spreading the virus, seen not only in Egypt, but in many low- and middle-income countries.</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Can education counter the popular belief that injections works against most everything?</em></li>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to make sure that the needle being used in a medical procedure was sterile?</em></li>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to make sure that the needle being used for an injection in a market stall was sterile?</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A key question that was asked in country after country with regard to tainted blood and HIV/AIDS could also be applied to HCV:</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Did public health do enough and in time to curb the spread of non-A, non-B hepatitis?

How can they be identified? And should they be identified if the resources </em><em>treat them are lacking</em><em>? </em></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Universal screening – testing everyone systematically for HCV – is one approach, at least in theory. But, in most countries that is not practical, nor fiscally responsible, given all the other health priorities. Besides, a screening test only confirms past exposure to the virus. That would need to be followed up with other more costly tests that 1) confirm the continued presence of the virus circulating in the blood, and in what amounts, and 2) determine the degree damage to the liver. It is a cascade of testing that can quickly become very costly.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ideally, what researchers would like to see is a single, inexpensive blood or serology test that provides all the relevant information. But a test like that is currently only a dream.</p>\n<em>If you rule out universal screening, you then move to selective screening of high-risk groups. But who do you target first?</em>\n\nIn the U.S. and Canada, systematic screening of all Baby Boomers is recommended – specifically everyone born between 1945 and 1965 in the U.S. and 1945 to 1975 in Canada.\n\nThis demographic group is singled out because they are at significant risk of having been exposed to tainted blood through a transfusion, through the sharing of needles and unprotected sex. Because HCV infection often takes decades to have serious health impacts – like cirrhosis and liver cancer – this group is also most likely to suffer health impacts.\n\nInjection drug users and prisoners are also obvious targets for screening, as are blood donors who are rejected because they have one or more risk factors. But it cannot be forgotten that a significant proportion of HCV carriers – as many as one in four – have no obvious risk factors. Many countries are also adding hepatitis C to the current panel of screening tests done on pregnant women, in the hope they can prevent the virus from being passed on from mother-to-child.\n\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7sKLcICED7Q?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It should be noted, however, that a number of countries, such as the Scandinavian nations, have made a decision to not screen for hepatitis C. Their reasoning is that the incidence of HCV - the number of new cases - has been close to zero for the past 20 years and that the rare cases found are usually imported, i.e. they would not be found by screening residents of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Testing is fraught with ethical questions.</em></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on present knowledge, roughly 70 per cent of those infected will probably not develop serious complications as a result of their infection. However, the test in itself cannot determine whether a patient will be among the 30 per cent who will develop a life-threatening liver disease. In addition, it is not known whether the 70/30 division will hold up over the long term. Only time will tell.</p>\nCurrent treatment protocols call for offering treatment first to patients showing the effects of chronic HCV infection, because it is believed they are most likely to develop cirrhosis or liver cancer. But how do you reassure the other 70 per cent, the people who know they are infected but have no obvious illness? Will they be satisfied with simply being monitored, knowing they too could fall ill down the road?\n\n<span style="color: #000000;">The key ethical question is whether you should actually test broadly if the resources do not exist to treat and care for everyone who has been identified as a carrier.</span>\n\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DmRaC6BsURc?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But it could also be argued that even if there is no promise of treatment, it would still be valuable to know whether you are infected. Because of the preventive steps you can take, like drinking less alcohol, and reducing the stress on the liver. Or being careful not to infect others (e.g., not sharing toothbrushes or razors with others, informing dentists and health care workers of infection status).</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If treatment is unavailable, should people be informed that they are infected with a virus that could potentially cause cancer? Is it unethical to withhold that information?</p>\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3QAP8fdq5X4?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Once identified, what next?</em></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis C is a resource-intensive disease that many health systems will find hard to manage. A strong health system is required, and the ever-growing case load can potentially overwhelm even well-endowed systems.</p>\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_s6bDMbzmQ?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\n\nOne way low- and middle income countries have dealt with the crush burden of HIV/AIDS, has been to establish a parallel health system, caring only for patient with that condition. Could that approach, called “vertical programs,” also work for hepatitis C? And does this offering of specialized care strengthen or weaken the overall health system? The experience that countries in West Africa lived with the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak is that this approach may be counter-productive, leaving the rest of the system weak and vulnerable to new challenges. Ideally, investing in programs to treat diseases like HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C should be done in a manner that bolsters the system overall.\n\nThe countries that do have a hepatitis policy usually have well-functioning health systems in place to build on, to integrate hepatitis into what already exists.\n\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B1T4XcjX24c?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to note, however, that the expertise that has been built up in the HIV/AIDS programs could also be used to manage viral hepatitis, especially given the fact that the burden of HIV/AIDS is falling, and that of HCV is growing.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Do countries need a specific hepatitis policy?</em></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It depends, as often is the case, on the local settings.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If the health system has the capacity and the resources to treat and follow a patient with chronic hepatitis like they would treat and follow up any other patient, then probably not.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If the health system does not have that capacity, then a plan, based on know-how from WHO‛s Global Hepatitis Program may be a good idea, because it will tell what to do and in which order. Also it can be a tool for accountability, to make sure things are being done.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The accumulated case load is again the obstacle. Dealing with a crisis usually comes at a cost, financial and managerial, somewhere else in the system. Most, maybe all, health systems don’t run with funds and personnel to spare. Budgets and resources are limited, even in the strongest, most developed and well-resourced health systems. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa, so overwhelmed Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, that even with foreign assistance, other serious health problems could not be addressed; maternal health, malaria, vaccinations, as well as many emergency rooms were severely affected. Even high income countries may run into problems caused by a surge in need for a particular treatment or test. After beginning to offer screening for colorectal cancers to all persons between the ages of 50-74 years, the healthcare system in Denmark witnessed an unexpected increase in waiting lists―so many more patients than anticipated needed follow-up colonoscopies that a number of hospital units could not keep up, despite having had years to prepare for the roll out of the screening program.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Other questions to ask:</em></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Doctors decide, based on guidelines, which patients receive treatment first.</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How are patients told they are not yet eligible for treatment? How do ineligible patients feel?</em></li>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>What do you do as a journalist when approached by an ineligible patient? Do you write their story, trying to make the doctor change his or her mind?</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Current protocols for treating HIV-positive individuals recommend initiation of triple therapy as soon as infection is confirmed and not waiting several years for the immune system to be compromised.</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Why then do HCV-positive individuals have to wait?</em></li>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>The same question could be asked for statins that are readily given to prevent heart attacks and strokes.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 name="sec5" style="text-align: justify;">5. <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Challenges around Treatment</span></strong></h2>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Drug Costs and Access to Treatment</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis C drugs are expensive – as much as $1,000 a pill. But they offer great promise – the real possibility of cure for many HCV carriers, and preventing a countless number of future infections.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">How drugs are priced, the profits they generate and the benefits they confer are the subject of much debate, and nowhere more so than when it comes to hepatitis C, because of the tremendous numbers of people infected.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some believe the price the pharmaceutical companies are asking for new drugs like Harvoni are based on what they can extract from governments and insurance companies rather than actual costs plus a reasonable return. Companies argue that the cost of research and development are astronomical and the drugs, while highly-priced, are a good investment because of the benefits to sufferers and the future HCV cases that will be prevented.</p>\nIn reality, we often don’t know the actual price paid, because list prices vary by country, and insurance plans, private and public, negotiate discounts.\n\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CyomWClUeGk?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\n\nWith HIV/AIDS drugs, these tiered pricing schemes, and agreements signed with generic companies have brought prices down markedly and made treatment available to millions.\n\nWill the same thing happen with hepatitis C drugs?\n\nWe don’t know.\n\nWhat is known is that strong advocacy and the involvement of high-profile global health groups like The Global Fund, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Clinton Foundation created tremendous pressure to find solutions. Hepatitis C does not have that profile and the backing of people with star power – at least not yet.\n\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wZVs9zImIBQ?feature=oembed&amp;start=2" width="604" height="340" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Who to treat and follow up?</em>\n\nCurrent European and American guidelines do not recommend treating all those who test positive as soon as they are found. Most infected are asymptomatic for years and considered in no urgent need of treatment. Giving the medication too early may cause more harm than benefit.\n\nBased on the progression of disease, the physician will decide when to start the treatment. However, there is no universal agreement on when that time is.\n\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ptks9wMhJXY?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment rids the body of the hepatitis C virus, but it does not eliminate or reverse liver disease. So the word “cure” is a bit misleading. Still, if the progression of disease can be halted, there should be less liver disease in the future, and that holds out the promise of drastically reducing the need for liver transplants, a very costly procedure. But reaping those savings in some distant future comes with a heavy price in the here and now. Today, health care systems are hit twice - they have to pay for the treatment as well as for liver transplants for those who have had chronic infection. To those already in need of a new liver the cure has come too late.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> <em>Will lowering the price of the drugs solve all problems? </em></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Not necessarily. Of course it will make the drugs more accessible, but some of the bottlenecks in the system will remain, even if the drugs were available for free.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the first hurdles to overcome is having the drug registered within every country in which it is going to be used. The pharmaceutical company holding the rights to a product may not want to register it, because it will be too costly compared to what they can expect to earn. A generic manufacturer may also have concerns, because a generic drug has to be prequalified by the WHO, which is also costly.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment involves testing, and tests have a price as well, not to mention that laboratories and trained personnel are required. Even in the industrialized countries trained personnel are in short supply. There are few physicians who specialize in liver disease, and taking on an extra caseload will be a challenge for them. Health systems do not have the excess capacity.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> <em>Questions worth asking:</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li><em>Is there a limit to how many new, high priced drugs governments and insurance companies are willing to pay for?</em></li>\n	<li><em>Will price be an (overruling) indicator for which patients will be given access to expensive drugs?</em></li>\n	<li>Usually pharmaceutical companies use the argument of cost of research, clinical trials, approval, and drug candidates that turned out to be blind end, to justify prices. <em>But once those costs have been recuperated, will prices come down?</em></li>\n</ul>\n<em>Developing stories to keep in mind:</em>\n\nAt the Millennium Summit at the United Nations in September 2000, world leaders committed to help achieve the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. The MDGs are to be replaced by Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that from 2016 and onwards will set targets for future international development.\n<ul>\n	<li><em>Will HCV be a specific SDG?</em></li>\n</ul>\nThe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is a public-private partnership that began operating in 2002 as an international financing organization that aims to »attract and disburse additional resources to prevent and treat HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria«.\n<ul>\n	<li>Recently The Fund simplified its logo to just: The Global Fund.<em> Is The Global Fund about to embrace HCV?</em></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;', 'Public policy', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '22-autosave-v1', '', '', '2015-11-06 20:00:00', '2015-11-06 20:00:00', '', 22, 'http://localhost/projects/clients/WFSJ/web/?p=195', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Doctors have known about HCV – or, as it was long known, non-A non-B hepatitis - for years, but it was believed to be less problematic than its better known viral cousins, hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Besides, there were other, more formidable, infectious disease challenges that came along, like AIDS, that pre-occupied public health officials and politicians. But quietly, over time, scientific knowledge of hepatitis C grew and, along with it, the sobering realization that it is one of the world’s biggest killers, claiming as many lives as hepatitis B, and even more than malaria.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But, unlike other forms of viral hepatitis, there are effective treatments for HCV, and that means many of the estimated 700,000 deaths the disease claims annually are preventable – at least in theory. These treatments come at a high price and good data are lacking on how many are truly infected on a global scale, and who would benefit most from treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Medicine, however, is only part of the story. HCV is a political and public health challenge on a global scale and, to come to grips with it, we must address many questions:</p>\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">How HCV has become a public health crisis.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">What is the best public health response to the epidemic?</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">Who should be screened, and how?</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">The challenges around treatment beyond cost.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This section will focus on these issues and more, providing fodder for inquisitive journalists.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2.<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"> The Unseen Epidemic: events behind the HCV crisis</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The role of public health is to protect and improve the health of the population, not just individuals. Prevention and health promotion initiatives help routine challenges, such as the spread of infectious diseases, from developing into crises. However, public health officials rarely have the final say on priority-setting, adoption of specific strategies, or how much money will be allocated to the response. That belongs to politicians, and they may accept, ignore, or even go against expert advice, for a host of economic or political reasons.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">How to respond to hepatitis C proved to be a major challenge for public health experts and policy-makers. At first, they had little solid information to guide their response. While scientists had known since the mid-70s that there was a variant of hepatitis that was neither A nor B, they could not pinpoint it. There was no test to detect it and no vaccine to prevent it. They also assumed, quite reasonably that the virus was not that big of a deal because few people fell acutely ill. They would realize only later that the virus gnawed away slowly at the liver and caused grave conditions like liver cancer and cirrhosis decades later.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV was finally given a proper name in 1989, when the virus was discovered. Soon after, an antibody test was developed to screen blood for the virus, and public health officials and regulators began the process of creating blood screening strategies. It was believed that this would help contain the spread of the virus. However, at the time, whether this was necessary was a matter of debate. HCV was seen as a small-scale problem, causing only minor manifestations in relatively few patients, many of whom were believed to clear the infection after the initial symptoms.

A Global Hepatitis Program has also been set up within the WHO to set standards and issue guidelines to help countries formulate specific hepatitis policies for prevention and treatment.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-lyEJQYBnDM?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Hepatitis C had little profile as a public health issue because was it was thought to be a problem mainly confined to intravenous drug users.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ywPfw-vhEM?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;As screening increased, it was discovered that out of the approximately 150 million individuals living with chronic hepatitis C only some 10 million got it through injection drug use. The vast majority contracted the virus via contact with the health system, through blood transfusions, unsafe injections and other health care exposures with poor infection control practices.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4i2tHXkX_lE?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>Another factor contributing to the crisis might possibly be doctors themselves.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qT_B_pb0XTo?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2>&nbsp;<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">3.</span> P for Public Health: Protection - Prevention - Promotion - Prognosis - Provision</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The role of public health</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Public Health tools for handling HCV could include:</p>\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n<li><strong>Surveillance and patient screening</strong>:<br>\r\nmonitoring national prevalence (number of total cases) and incidence (number of new cases in a given period of time) of the virus, identifying asymptomatic chronic carriers, following these patients to determine when to provide treatment and making sure they adhere to the prescribed regimen</li>\r\n<li><strong>Education:</strong><br>\r\ndisseminating information to the public and health professionals about the disease, risk factors, how to avoid infection, etc. on a regular basis and with a special effort on national and community level to mark World Hepatitis Day on July 28<br>\r\ninitiating health education and training to reduce risk of transmission during exposures in nonmedical (e.g., commercial barbering, body piercing, tattoos, and traditional circumcision) and occupational (e.g., health care and sanitation worker) settings.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Testing Blood products</strong>:<br>\r\ntesting all blood used for transfusions and blood products<br>\r\nvirus inactivation (heat-treatment) of plasma-derived products<br>\r\nencouraging the use of as little transfusion blood as possible</li>\r\n<li><strong>Infection-Control</strong>:<br>\r\nenforcing infection control practices<br>\r\nencouraging the use of therapeutic syringes with features to prevent reuse and injuries as well as safe handling and disposal of sharps and waste<br>\r\nencouraging adequate sterilization of reusable material such as surgical or dental instruments</li>\r\n<li><strong>Counseling:</strong><br>\r\npeople with chronic, asymptomatic HCV<br>\r\nincluding teaching them not to share toothbrushes and razors with others and to let their dentist and other medical workers know of their infection status, giving these individuals the opportunity to protect themselves appropriately</li>\r\n<li><strong>Harm Reduction</strong>:<br>\r\ninitiating harm reduction programs, with counseling, needle-syringe exchange and opiate substitution therapy for injection drug users</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However resources are limited, and as a result, political prioritization guides public health decisions. Public health may make recommendations, but whether or not these recommendations will be acted upon is something that will be determined at the political level. Therefore it is important to understand that there is public health and there are politics and these are not always aligned.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>This is also fertile ground for journalism</em>: to document and explore the discrepancies between promises and action.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventing the spread of HCV does not require reinventing the wheel. Many of these strategies are already used to prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS: the screening of donor blood and blood products, universal infection control practices, education, and harm reduction. A number of the steps that have been used against HIV/AIDS likely helped curb the spread of HCV because they have similar routes of transmission and there is some co-infection.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, HCV can stay active outside the human body much longer than HIV. Consequently, infection control practices (e.g., hand-washing, sterilization of reusable medical equipment, and cleaning of surfaces) have to be even stricter for HCV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All the HIV/AIDS prevention efforts never managed to curtail one significant contributor to the spread of blood-borne infections in low- and middle-income countries: unnecessary injections. In Egypt, where there is a generalized HCV epidemic, the prevalence is highest in people with ongoing or a past history of medical injections. It will require determined education efforts to change the practice of re-using needles for vaccinations and other procedures.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, what is needed most fundamentally to prevent the spread of infectious diseases like hepatitis C is a well-functioning and well-staffed healthcare system – something that does not exist in many countries - along with political will, a willingness to invest in safer healthcare.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YV2zVQC5-z0?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Many countries have only applied a few of the public health tools against HCV. Is that an option?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As most chronic patients are asymptomatic it might seem easy to ignore the disease, but there can be serious impacts on a community or a country’s health care resources. If a large group of individuals begins to exhibit liver disease within the same time frame, as expected in this case, then governments will indeed be faced with an acute problem. What course of action politicians decide to take determines the outcome of this public health issue.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of instituting sound health policies can slow their adoption. For example, when a blood test for HCV became available in the early 1990s, some countries were slow to incorporate it as part of the regular screening of blood in hospitals as they had already spent a considerable amount in the 1980s to set up screening for HIV/AIDS.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Even before HCV was identified in 1989 it was known that a non-A, non-B hepatitis was circulating in the blood supply. It is estimated that in the 1970s in the U.S., the risk of contracting hepatitis from blood-transfusion was as high as 30 per cent. Thanks to screening of donor blood, that risk dropped to almost zero by the year 2000.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WsB0L7KqU18?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Questions worth asking:</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Overuse of (unnecessary) injections with unsterile equipment seems to be a driver in spreading the virus, seen not only in Egypt, but in many low- and middle-income countries.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Can education counter the popular belief that injections works against most everything?</em></li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to make sure that the needle being used in a medical procedure was sterile?</em></li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to make sure that the needle being used for an injection in a market stall was sterile?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A key question that was asked in country after country with regard to tainted blood and HIV/AIDS could also be applied to HCV:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Did public health do enough and in time to curb the spread of non-A, non-B hepatitis? Or did they opt to do nothing to save money?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2>&nbsp;4. <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">The unknowingly infected</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Screening Strategies: How to find those who are infected and do not know it?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>A large number of people infected with HCV are ‛silent carriers‛ - meaning they show no symptoms for years, even decades. How can they be identified? And should they be identified if the resources </em><em>treat them are lacking</em><em>? </em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Universal screening – testing everyone systematically for HCV – is one approach, at least in theory. But, in most countries that is not practical, nor fiscally responsible, given all the other health priorities. Besides, a screening test only confirms past exposure to the virus. That would need to be followed up with other more costly tests that 1) confirm the continued presence of the virus circulating in the blood, and in what amounts, and 2) determine the degree damage to the liver. It is a cascade of testing that can quickly become very costly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ideally, what researchers would like to see is a single, inexpensive blood or serology test that provides all the relevant information. But a test like that is currently only a dream.</p>\r\n<p><em>If you rule out universal screening, you then move to selective screening of high-risk groups. But who do you target first?</em></p>\r\n<p>In the U.S. and Canada, systematic screening of all Baby Boomers is recommended – specifically everyone born between 1945 and 1965 in the U.S. and 1945 to 1975 in Canada.</p>\r\n<p>This demographic group is singled out because they are at significant risk of having been exposed to tainted blood through a transfusion, through the sharing of needles and unprotected sex. Because HCV infection often takes decades to have serious health impacts – like cirrhosis and liver cancer – this group is also most likely to suffer health impacts.</p>\r\n<p>Injection drug users and prisoners are also obvious targets for screening, as are blood donors who are rejected because they have one or more risk factors. But it cannot be forgotten that a significant proportion of HCV carriers – as many as one in four – have no obvious risk factors. Many countries are also adding hepatitis C to the current panel of screening tests done on pregnant women, in the hope they can prevent the virus from being passed on from mother-to-child.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7sKLcICED7Q?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It should be noted, however, that a number of countries, such as the Scandinavian nations, have made a decision to not screen for hepatitis C. Their reasoning is that the incidence of HCV - the number of new cases - has been close to zero for the past 20 years and that the rare cases found are usually imported, i.e. they would not be found by screening residents of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Testing is fraught with ethical questions.</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on present knowledge, roughly 70 per cent of those infected will probably not develop serious complications as a result of their infection. However, the test in itself cannot determine whether a patient will be among the 30 per cent who will develop a life-threatening liver disease. In addition, it is not known whether the 70/30 division will hold up over the long term. Only time will tell.</p>\r\n<p>Current treatment protocols call for offering treatment first to patients showing the effects of chronic HCV infection, because it is believed they are most likely to develop cirrhosis or liver cancer. But how do you reassure the other 70 per cent, the people who know they are infected but have no obvious illness? Will they be satisfied with simply being monitored, knowing they too could fall ill down the road?</p>\r\n<p><span style="color: #000000;">The key ethical question is whether you should actually test broadly if the resources do not exist to treat and care for everyone who has been identified as a carrier.</span></p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DmRaC6BsURc?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But it could also be argued that even if there is no promise of treatment, it would still be valuable to know whether you are infected. Because of the preventive steps you can take, like drinking less alcohol, and reducing the stress on the liver. Or being careful not to infect others (e.g., not sharing toothbrushes or razors with others, informing dentists and health care workers of infection status).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If treatment is unavailable, should people be informed that they are infected with a virus that could potentially cause cancer? Is it unethical to withhold that information?</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3QAP8fdq5X4?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Once identified, what next?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis C is a resource-intensive disease that many health systems will find hard to manage. A strong health system is required, and the ever-growing case load can potentially overwhelm even well-endowed systems.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_s6bDMbzmQ?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>One way low- and middle income countries have dealt with the crush burden of HIV/AIDS, has been to establish a parallel health system, caring only for patient with that condition. Could that approach, called “vertical programs,” also work for hepatitis C? And does this offering of specialized care strengthen or weaken the overall health system? The experience that countries in West Africa lived with the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak is that this approach may be counter-productive, leaving the rest of the system weak and vulnerable to new challenges. Ideally, investing in programs to treat diseases like HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C should be done in a manner that bolsters the system overall.</p>\r\n<p>The countries that do have a hepatitis policy usually have well-functioning health systems in place to build on, to integrate hepatitis into what already exists.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B1T4XcjX24c?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to note, however, that the expertise that has been built up in the HIV/AIDS programs could also be used to manage viral hepatitis, especially given the fact that the burden of HIV/AIDS is falling, and that of HCV is growing.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Do countries need a specific hepatitis policy?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It depends, as often is the case, on the local settings.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If the health system has the capacity and the resources to treat and follow a patient with chronic hepatitis like they would treat and follow up any other patient, then probably not.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If the health system does not have that capacity, then a plan, based on know-how from WHO‛s Global Hepatitis Program may be a good idea, because it will tell what to do and in which order. Also it can be a tool for accountability, to make sure things are being done.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The accumulated case load is again the obstacle. Dealing with a crisis usually comes at a cost, financial and managerial, somewhere else in the system. Most, maybe all, health systems don’t run with funds and personnel to spare. Budgets and resources are limited, even in the strongest, most developed and well-resourced health systems. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa, so overwhelmed Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, that even with foreign assistance, other serious health problems could not be addressed; maternal health, malaria, vaccinations, as well as many emergency rooms were severely affected. Even high income countries may run into problems caused by a surge in need for a particular treatment or test. After beginning to offer screening for colorectal cancers to all persons between the ages of 50-74 years, the healthcare system in Denmark witnessed an unexpected increase in waiting lists―so many more patients than anticipated needed follow-up colonoscopies that a number of hospital units could not keep up, despite having had years to prepare for the roll out of the screening program.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Other questions to ask:</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Doctors decide, based on guidelines, which patients receive treatment first.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How are patients told they are not yet eligible for treatment? How do ineligible patients feel?</em></li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>What do you do as a journalist when approached by an ineligible patient? Do you write their story, trying to make the doctor change his or her mind?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Current protocols for treating HIV-positive individuals recommend initiation of triple therapy as soon as infection is confirmed and not waiting several years for the immune system to be compromised.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Why then do HCV-positive individuals have to wait?</em></li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>The same question could be asked for statins that are readily given to prevent heart attacks and strokes.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;">5. <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Challenges around Treatment</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Drug Costs and Access to Treatment</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis C drugs are expensive – as much as $1,000 a pill. But they offer great promise – the real possibility of cure for many HCV carriers, and preventing a countless number of future infections.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">How drugs are priced, the profits they generate and the benefits they confer are the subject of much debate, and nowhere more so than when it comes to hepatitis C, because of the tremendous numbers of people infected.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some believe the price the pharmaceutical companies are asking for new drugs like Harvoni are based on what they can extract from governments and insurance companies rather than actual costs plus a reasonable return. Companies argue that the cost of research and development are astronomical and the drugs, while highly-priced, are a good investment because of the benefits to sufferers and the future HCV cases that will be prevented.</p>\r\n<p>In reality, we often don’t know the actual price paid, because list prices vary by country, and insurance plans, private and public, negotiate discounts.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CyomWClUeGk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>With HIV/AIDS drugs, these tiered pricing schemes, and agreements signed with generic companies have brought prices down markedly and made treatment available to millions.</p>\r\n<p>Will the same thing happen with hepatitis C drugs?</p>\r\n<p>We don’t know.</p>\r\n<p>What is known is that strong advocacy and the involvement of high-profile global health groups like The Global Fund, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Clinton Foundation created tremendous pressure to find solutions. Hepatitis C does not have that profile and the backing of people with star power – at least not yet.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wZVs9zImIBQ?feature=oembed&amp;start=2" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="340" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Who to treat and follow up?</em></p>\r\n<p>Current European and American guidelines do not recommend treating all those who test positive as soon as they are found. Most infected are asymptomatic for years and considered in no urgent need of treatment. Giving the medication too early may cause more harm than benefit.</p>\r\n<p>Based on the progression of disease, the physician will decide when to start the treatment. However, there is no universal agreement on when that time is.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ptks9wMhJXY?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment rids the body of the hepatitis C virus, but it does not eliminate or reverse liver disease. So the word “cure” is a bit misleading. Still, if the progression of disease can be halted, there should be less liver disease in the future, and that holds out the promise of drastically reducing the need for liver transplants, a very costly procedure. But reaping those savings in some distant future comes with a heavy price in the here and now. Today, health care systems are hit twice - they have to pay for the treatment as well as for liver transplants for those who have had chronic infection. To those already in need of a new liver the cure has come too late.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;<em>Will lowering the price of the drugs solve all problems? </em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Not necessarily. Of course it will make the drugs more accessible, but some of the bottlenecks in the system will remain, even if the drugs were available for free.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the first hurdles to overcome is having the drug registered within every country in which it is going to be used. The pharmaceutical company holding the rights to a product may not want to register it, because it will be too costly compared to what they can expect to earn. A generic manufacturer may also have concerns, because a generic drug has to be prequalified by the WHO, which is also costly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment involves testing, and tests have a price as well, not to mention that laboratories and trained personnel are required. Even in the industrialized countries trained personnel are in short supply. There are few physicians who specialize in liver disease, and taking on an extra caseload will be a challenge for them. Health systems do not have the excess capacity.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;<em>Questions worth asking:</em></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>Is there a limit to how many new, high priced drugs governments and insurance companies are willing to pay for?</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Will price be an (overruling) indicator for which patients will be given access to expensive drugs?</em></li>\r\n<li>Usually pharmaceutical companies use the argument of cost of research, clinical trials, approval, and drug candidates that turned out to be blind end, to justify prices. <em>But once those costs have been recuperated, will prices come down?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em>Developing stories to keep in mind:</em></p>\r\n<p>At the Millennium Summit at the United Nations in September 2000, world leaders committed to help achieve the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.

Doctors have known about HCV – or, as it was long known, non-A non-B hepatitis - for years, but it was believed to be less problematic than its better known viral cousins, hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Besides, there were other, more formidable, infectious disease challenges that came along, like AIDS, that pre-occupied public health officials and politicians. But quietly, over time, scientific knowledge of hepatitis C grew and, along with it, the sobering realization that it is one of the world’s biggest killers, claiming as many lives as hepatitis B, and even more than malaria.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But, unlike other forms of viral hepatitis, there are effective treatments for HCV, and that means many of the estimated 700,000 deaths the disease claims annually are preventable – at least in theory. These treatments come at a high price and good data are lacking on how many are truly infected on a global scale, and who would benefit most from treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Medicine, however, is only part of the story. HCV is a political and public health challenge on a global scale and, to come to grips with it, we must address many questions:</p>\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">How HCV has become a public health crisis.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">What is the best public health response to the epidemic?</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">Who should be screened, and how?</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">The challenges around treatment beyond cost.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This section will focus on these issues and more, providing fodder for inquisitive journalists.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2.<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"> The Unseen Epidemic: events behind the HCV crisis</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The role of public health is to protect and improve the health of the population, not just individuals. Prevention and health promotion initiatives help routine challenges, such as the spread of infectious diseases, from developing into crises. However, public health officials rarely have the final say on priority-setting, adoption of specific strategies, or how much money will be allocated to the response. That belongs to politicians, and they may accept, ignore, or even go against expert advice, for a host of economic or political reasons.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">How to respond to hepatitis C proved to be a major challenge for public health experts and policy-makers. At first, they had little solid information to guide their response. While scientists had known since the mid-70s that there was a variant of hepatitis that was neither A nor B, they could not pinpoint it. There was no test to detect it and no vaccine to prevent it. They also assumed, quite reasonably that the virus was not that big of a deal because few people fell acutely ill. They would realize only later that the virus gnawed away slowly at the liver and caused grave conditions like liver cancer and cirrhosis decades later.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV was finally given a proper name in 1989, when the virus was discovered. Soon after, an antibody test was developed to screen blood for the virus, and public health officials and regulators began the process of creating blood screening strategies. It was believed that this would help contain the spread of the virus. However, at the time, whether this was necessary was a matter of debate. HCV was seen as a small-scale problem, causing only minor manifestations in relatively few patients, many of whom were believed to clear the infection after the initial symptoms. No one knew HCV caused chronic infections or that carriers of the virus were able to infect others even when they had no obvious signs of illness.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZouPfK_E2j0?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As the global impact of HCV has become apparent, the World Health Assembly - WHO’s governing body - has adopted a number of resolutions. In 2011, July 28 was officially recognized as World Hepatitis Day - to create awareness, strengthen prevention and coordinate a global response. A Global Hepatitis Program has also been set up within the WHO to set standards and issue guidelines to help countries formulate specific hepatitis policies for prevention and treatment.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-lyEJQYBnDM?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Hepatitis C had little profile as a public health issue because was it was thought to be a problem mainly confined to intravenous drug users.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ywPfw-vhEM?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;As screening increased, it was discovered that out of the approximately 150 million individuals living with chronic hepatitis C only some 10 million got it through injection drug use. The vast majority contracted the virus via contact with the health system, through blood transfusions, unsafe injections and other health care exposures with poor infection control practices.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4i2tHXkX_lE?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>Another factor contributing to the crisis might possibly be doctors themselves.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qT_B_pb0XTo?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2>&nbsp;<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">3.</span> P for Public Health: Protection - Prevention - Promotion - Prognosis - Provision</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The role of public health</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Public Health tools for handling HCV could include:</p>\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n<li><strong>Surveillance and patient screening</strong>:<br>\r\nmonitoring national prevalence (number of total cases) and incidence (number of new cases in a given period of time) of the virus, identifying asymptomatic chronic carriers, following these patients to determine when to provide treatment and making sure they adhere to the prescribed regimen</li>\r\n<li><strong>Education:</strong><br>\r\ndisseminating information to the public and health professionals about the disease, risk factors, how to avoid infection, etc. on a regular basis and with a special effort on national and community level to mark World Hepatitis Day on July 28<br>\r\ninitiating health education and training to reduce risk of transmission during exposures in nonmedical (e.g., commercial barbering, body piercing, tattoos, and traditional circumcision) and occupational (e.g., health care and sanitation worker) settings.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Testing Blood products</strong>:<br>\r\ntesting all blood used for transfusions and blood products<br>\r\nvirus inactivation (heat-treatment) of plasma-derived products<br>\r\nencouraging the use of as little transfusion blood as possible</li>\r\n<li><strong>Infection-Control</strong>:<br>\r\nenforcing infection control practices<br>\r\nencouraging the use of therapeutic syringes with features to prevent reuse and injuries as well as safe handling and disposal of sharps and waste<br>\r\nencouraging adequate sterilization of reusable material such as surgical or dental instruments</li>\r\n<li><strong>Counseling:</strong><br>\r\npeople with chronic, asymptomatic HCV<br>\r\nincluding teaching them not to share toothbrushes and razors with others and to let their dentist and other medical workers know of their infection status, giving these individuals the opportunity to protect themselves appropriately</li>\r\n<li><strong>Harm Reduction</strong>:<br>\r\ninitiating harm reduction programs, with counseling, needle-syringe exchange and opiate substitution therapy for injection drug users</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However resources are limited, and as a result, political prioritization guides public health decisions. Public health may make recommendations, but whether or not these recommendations will be acted upon is something that will be determined at the political level. Therefore it is important to understand that there is public health and there are politics and these are not always aligned.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>This is also fertile ground for journalism</em>: to document and explore the discrepancies between promises and action.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventing the spread of HCV does not require reinventing the wheel. Many of these strategies are already used to prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS: the screening of donor blood and blood products, universal infection control practices, education, and harm reduction. A number of the steps that have been used against HIV/AIDS likely helped curb the spread of HCV because they have similar routes of transmission and there is some co-infection.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, HCV can stay active outside the human body much longer than HIV. Consequently, infection control practices (e.g., hand-washing, sterilization of reusable medical equipment, and cleaning of surfaces) have to be even stricter for HCV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All the HIV/AIDS prevention efforts never managed to curtail one significant contributor to the spread of blood-borne infections in low- and middle-income countries: unnecessary injections. In Egypt, where there is a generalized HCV epidemic, the prevalence is highest in people with ongoing or a past history of medical injections. It will require determined education efforts to change the practice of re-using needles for vaccinations and other procedures.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, what is needed most fundamentally to prevent the spread of infectious diseases like hepatitis C is a well-functioning and well-staffed healthcare system – something that does not exist in many countries - along with political will, a willingness to invest in safer healthcare.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YV2zVQC5-z0?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Many countries have only applied a few of the public health tools against HCV. Is that an option?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As most chronic patients are asymptomatic it might seem easy to ignore the disease, but there can be serious impacts on a community or a country’s health care resources. If a large group of individuals begins to exhibit liver disease within the same time frame, as expected in this case, then governments will indeed be faced with an acute problem. What course of action politicians decide to take determines the outcome of this public health issue.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of instituting sound health policies can slow their adoption. For example, when a blood test for HCV became available in the early 1990s, some countries were slow to incorporate it as part of the regular screening of blood in hospitals as they had already spent a considerable amount in the 1980s to set up screening for HIV/AIDS.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Even before HCV was identified in 1989 it was known that a non-A, non-B hepatitis was circulating in the blood supply. It is estimated that in the 1970s in the U.S., the risk of contracting hepatitis from blood-transfusion was as high as 30 per cent. Thanks to screening of donor blood, that risk dropped to almost zero by the year 2000.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WsB0L7KqU18?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Questions worth asking:</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Overuse of (unnecessary) injections with unsterile equipment seems to be a driver in spreading the virus, seen not only in Egypt, but in many low- and middle-income countries.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Can education counter the popular belief that injections works against most everything?</em></li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to make sure that the needle being used in a medical procedure was sterile?</em></li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to make sure that the needle being used for an injection in a market stall was sterile?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A key question that was asked in country after country with regard to tainted blood and HIV/AIDS could also be applied to HCV:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Did public health do enough and in time to curb the spread of non-A, non-B hepatitis? Or did they opt to do nothing to save money?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2>&nbsp;4. <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">The unknowingly infected</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Screening Strategies: How to find those who are infected and do not know it?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>A large number of people infected with HCV are ‛silent carriers‛ - meaning they show no symptoms for years, even decades. How can they be identified? And should they be identified if the resources </em><em>treat them are lacking</em><em>? </em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Universal screening – testing everyone systematically for HCV – is one approach, at least in theory. But, in most countries that is not practical, nor fiscally responsible, given all the other health priorities. Besides, a screening test only confirms past exposure to the virus. That would need to be followed up with other more costly tests that 1) confirm the continued presence of the virus circulating in the blood, and in what amounts, and 2) determine the degree damage to the liver. It is a cascade of testing that can quickly become very costly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ideally, what researchers would like to see is a single, inexpensive blood or serology test that provides all the relevant information. But a test like that is currently only a dream.</p>\r\n<p><em>If you rule out universal screening, you then move to selective screening of high-risk groups. But who do you target first?</em></p>\r\n<p>In the U.S. and Canada, systematic screening of all Baby Boomers is recommended – specifically everyone born between 1945 and 1965 in the U.S. and 1945 to 1975 in Canada.</p>\r\n<p>This demographic group is singled out because they are at significant risk of having been exposed to tainted blood through a transfusion, through the sharing of needles and unprotected sex. Because HCV infection often takes decades to have serious health impacts – like cirrhosis and liver cancer – this group is also most likely to suffer health impacts.</p>\r\n<p>Injection drug users and prisoners are also obvious targets for screening, as are blood donors who are rejected because they have one or more risk factors. But it cannot be forgotten that a significant proportion of HCV carriers – as many as one in four – have no obvious risk factors. Many countries are also adding hepatitis C to the current panel of screening tests done on pregnant women, in the hope they can prevent the virus from being passed on from mother-to-child.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7sKLcICED7Q?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It should be noted, however, that a number of countries, such as the Scandinavian nations, have made a decision to not screen for hepatitis C. Their reasoning is that the incidence of HCV - the number of new cases - has been close to zero for the past 20 years and that the rare cases found are usually imported, i.e. they would not be found by screening residents of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Testing is fraught with ethical questions.</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on present knowledge, roughly 70 per cent of those infected will probably not develop serious complications as a result of their infection. However, the test in itself cannot determine whether a patient will be among the 30 per cent who will develop a life-threatening liver disease. In addition, it is not known whether the 70/30 division will hold up over the long term. Only time will tell.</p>\r\n<p>Current treatment protocols call for offering treatment first to patients showing the effects of chronic HCV infection, because it is believed they are most likely to develop cirrhosis or liver cancer. But how do you reassure the other 70 per cent, the people who know they are infected but have no obvious illness? Will they be satisfied with simply being monitored, knowing they too could fall ill down the road?</p>\r\n<p><span style="color: #000000;">The key ethical question is whether you should actually test broadly if the resources do not exist to treat and care for everyone who has been identified as a carrier.</span></p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DmRaC6BsURc?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But it could also be argued that even if there is no promise of treatment, it would still be valuable to know whether you are infected. Because of the preventive steps you can take, like drinking less alcohol, and reducing the stress on the liver. Or being careful not to infect others (e.g., not sharing toothbrushes or razors with others, informing dentists and health care workers of infection status).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If treatment is unavailable, should people be informed that they are infected with a virus that could potentially cause cancer? Is it unethical to withhold that information?</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3QAP8fdq5X4?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Once identified, what next?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis C is a resource-intensive disease that many health systems will find hard to manage. A strong health system is required, and the ever-growing case load can potentially overwhelm even well-endowed systems.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_s6bDMbzmQ?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>One way low- and middle income countries have dealt with the crush burden of HIV/AIDS, has been to establish a parallel health system, caring only for patient with that condition. Could that approach, called “vertical programs,” also work for hepatitis C? And does this offering of specialized care strengthen or weaken the overall health system? The experience that countries in West Africa lived with the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak is that this approach may be counter-productive, leaving the rest of the system weak and vulnerable to new challenges. Ideally, investing in programs to treat diseases like HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C should be done in a manner that bolsters the system overall.</p>\r\n<p>The countries that do have a hepatitis policy usually have well-functioning health systems in place to build on, to integrate hepatitis into what already exists.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B1T4XcjX24c?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to note, however, that the expertise that has been built up in the HIV/AIDS programs could also be used to manage viral hepatitis, especially given the fact that the burden of HIV/AIDS is falling, and that of HCV is growing.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Do countries need a specific hepatitis policy?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It depends, as often is the case, on the local settings.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If the health system has the capacity and the resources to treat and follow a patient with chronic hepatitis like they would treat and follow up any other patient, then probably not.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If the health system does not have that capacity, then a plan, based on know-how from WHO‛s Global Hepatitis Program may be a good idea, because it will tell what to do and in which order. Also it can be a tool for accountability, to make sure things are being done.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The accumulated case load is again the obstacle. Dealing with a crisis usually comes at a cost, financial and managerial, somewhere else in the system. Most, maybe all, health systems don’t run with funds and personnel to spare. Budgets and resources are limited, even in the strongest, most developed and well-resourced health systems. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa, so overwhelmed Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, that even with foreign assistance, other serious health problems could not be addressed; maternal health, malaria, vaccinations, as well as many emergency rooms were severely affected. Even high income countries may run into problems caused by a surge in need for a particular treatment or test. After beginning to offer screening for colorectal cancers to all persons between the ages of 50-74 years, the healthcare system in Denmark witnessed an unexpected increase in waiting lists―so many more patients than anticipated needed follow-up colonoscopies that a number of hospital units could not keep up, despite having had years to prepare for the roll out of the screening program.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Other questions to ask:</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Doctors decide, based on guidelines, which patients receive treatment first.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How are patients told they are not yet eligible for treatment? How do ineligible patients feel?</em></li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>What do you do as a journalist when approached by an ineligible patient? Do you write their story, trying to make the doctor change his or her mind?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Current protocols for treating HIV-positive individuals recommend initiation of triple therapy as soon as infection is confirmed and not waiting several years for the immune system to be compromised.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Why then do HCV-positive individuals have to wait?</em></li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>The same question could be asked for statins that are readily given to prevent heart attacks and strokes.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;">5. <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Challenges around Treatment</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Drug Costs and Access to Treatment</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis C drugs are expensive – as much as $1,000 a pill. But they offer great promise – the real possibility of cure for many HCV carriers, and preventing a countless number of future infections.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">How drugs are priced, the profits they generate and the benefits they confer are the subject of much debate, and nowhere more so than when it comes to hepatitis C, because of the tremendous numbers of people infected.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some believe the price the pharmaceutical companies are asking for new drugs like Harvoni are based on what they can extract from governments and insurance companies rather than actual costs plus a reasonable return. Companies argue that the cost of research and development are astronomical and the drugs, while highly-priced, are a good investment because of the benefits to sufferers and the future HCV cases that will be prevented.</p>\r\n<p>In reality, we often don’t know the actual price paid, because list prices vary by country, and insurance plans, private and public, negotiate discounts.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CyomWClUeGk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>With HIV/AIDS drugs, these tiered pricing schemes, and agreements signed with generic companies have brought prices down markedly and made treatment available to millions.</p>\r\n<p>Will the same thing happen with hepatitis C drugs?</p>\r\n<p>We don’t know.</p>\r\n<p>What is known is that strong advocacy and the involvement of high-profile global health groups like The Global Fund, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Clinton Foundation created tremendous pressure to find solutions. Hepatitis C does not have that profile and the backing of people with star power – at least not yet.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wZVs9zImIBQ?feature=oembed&amp;start=2" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="340" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Who to treat and follow up?</em></p>\r\n<p>Current European and American guidelines do not recommend treating all those who test positive as soon as they are found. Most infected are asymptomatic for years and considered in no urgent need of treatment. Giving the medication too early may cause more harm than benefit.</p>\r\n<p>Based on the progression of disease, the physician will decide when to start the treatment. However, there is no universal agreement on when that time is.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ptks9wMhJXY?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment rids the body of the hepatitis C virus, but it does not eliminate or reverse liver disease. So the word “cure” is a bit misleading. Still, if the progression of disease can be halted, there should be less liver disease in the future, and that holds out the promise of drastically reducing the need for liver transplants, a very costly procedure. But reaping those savings in some distant future comes with a heavy price in the here and now. Today, health care systems are hit twice - they have to pay for the treatment as well as for liver transplants for those who have had chronic infection. To those already in need of a new liver the cure has come too late.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;<em>Will lowering the price of the drugs solve all problems? </em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Not necessarily. Of course it will make the drugs more accessible, but some of the bottlenecks in the system will remain, even if the drugs were available for free.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the first hurdles to overcome is having the drug registered within every country in which it is going to be used. The pharmaceutical company holding the rights to a product may not want to register it, because it will be too costly compared to what they can expect to earn. A generic manufacturer may also have concerns, because a generic drug has to be prequalified by the WHO, which is also costly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment involves testing, and tests have a price as well, not to mention that laboratories and trained personnel are required. Even in the industrialized countries trained personnel are in short supply. There are few physicians who specialize in liver disease, and taking on an extra caseload will be a challenge for them. Health systems do not have the excess capacity.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;<em>Questions worth asking:</em></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>Is there a limit to how many new, high priced drugs governments and insurance companies are willing to pay for?</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Will price be an (overruling) indicator for which patients will be given access to expensive drugs?</em></li>\r\n<li>Usually pharmaceutical companies use the argument of cost of research, clinical trials, approval, and drug candidates that turned out to be blind end, to justify prices. <em>But once those costs have been recuperated, will prices come down?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em>Developing stories to keep in mind:</em></p>\r\n<p>At the Millennium Summit at the United Nations in September 2000, world leaders committed to help achieve the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.

Liver inflammation or damage can compromise liver function.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Acute Hepatitis </strong>C virus infection is a short-term illness that occurs within the first 6 months after someone is exposed to the Hepatitis C virus.

Hepatitis C virus infection can last a lifetime and lead to serious liver problems, including cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) or liver cancer.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This is because inflammation sustained over an extended period of time leads to liver damage, and repeated attempts to repair the tissue can result in the formation of scars of fibrous tissue.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Liver failure occurs When the liver cannot keep up with the body’s needs anymore, a condition that can be life-threatening and can be cured only by a liver transplant.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">2. <strong><a name="sec2"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Why is the liver so important ?

They are responsible for only 7% of the cases of viral hepatitis in the world.\r\n\r\nIn some rare cases <strong>adenovirus</strong>, <strong>cytomegalovirus</strong> (CMV), <strong>Epstein-Barr virus</strong> (EBV), or <strong>herpes simplex virus</strong> (HSV) can also cause hepatitis.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2041 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-1.jpg" alt="Table 1" width="1894" height="2663" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis D</strong> is caused by Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV). Because HDV needs the hepatitis B virus to replicate and survive in the body, it can only be found in people already infected with HBV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The HBV vaccine will therefore protect against both infections.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Like other hepatitis viruses, HDV is transmitted through contact with infected blood or blood products, semen, or other bodily fluids.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HDV infection of chronically infected HBV-carriers may lead to <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/hepatitis/whocdscsrncs20011/en/index7.html#fulminant">fulminant</a> acute hepatitis, a condition in which the liver produces a severe acute inflammatory response leading to extensive tissue damage and liver failure. It is 10 times more likely that fulminant acute hepatitis will develop in individuals co-infected with HDV and HBV than with other types of hepatitis viruses. It is also more likely for HDV/HDV co-infection to lead to severe chronic active hepatitis, increasing the risk of cirrhosis. Worldwide, more than 10 million people are infected with HDV, with a mortality rate between 2% and 20%, which is ten times higher than for hepatitis B alone.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis E</strong> is caused by Hepatitis E Virus, which infects about 20 million people in the world every year, leading to about 3 million cases of acute hepatitis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is transmitted mainly through contaminated drinking water worldwide, and is more common in East and South Asia. It usually resolves within 4–6 weeks, but in some cases can lead to a fulminant form of hepatitis, responsible for 56,600 deaths in the world every year.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The first vaccine to prevent hepatitis E virus infection has been produced and licensed in China, but is not yet available globally.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">5.<strong><a name="sec5"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How can different viral hepatitis be transmitted and how can transmission be prevented?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis A</strong> is transmitted through <strong>ingestion</strong> of microscopic amounts of fecal material, such as through contaminated food, drink, and objects.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis A transmission happens mainly by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">eating fruits, vegetables, or other foods contaminated during handling</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">eating raw shellfish harvested from contaminated water</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">swallowing contaminated ice.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">These at-risk behaviours should be avoided to prevent transmission, particularly when travelling to countries that have a high or intermediate prevalence of the disease.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vaccination is t</strong>he most effective way to prevent Hepatitis A.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis B</strong> is transmitted by contact with infected blood, semen, or other <strong>body fluids</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis B transmission can therefore happen by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">being born to an infected mother</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">having sexual intercourse with an infected person</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">sharing contaminated needles, syringes, or other injection drug equipment</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">being accidentally pricked by contaminated needlesticks or other sharp instruments (i.e healthcare professionals).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventative measures established for other blood and sexually transmitted diseases, both in healthcare and in everyday life, should be adopted to prevent Hepatitis B transmission.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Like Hepatitis A, the most effective way to prevent Hepatitis B is <strong>vaccination</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis C</strong> is spread through blood-to-blood contact. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water. Nor is it spread through casual contact, such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Infection can happen by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li>sharing contaminated needles, syringes, or other injection drug equipment</li>\r\n	<li>being accidentally pricked by contaminated needlesticks or other sharp instruments (i.e healthcare professionals)</li>\r\n	<li>having received a blood transfusion or organ transplant before the early 1990s in developed countries — when widespread screening for HCV was introduced with increasing levels of efficacy at detecting the virus. In low resource countries, blood safety remains an issue of major concern.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Birth to an infected mother is a less common mode of transmission. According to US Centers for Disease prevention and Control (CDC), approximately 6% of infants born to infected mothers will get Hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV infection can only be prevented by avoiding blood-to-blood contacts.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventative measures should also include getting tattoes and piercings in certified facilities that use sterile instruments. Healthcare workers should follow professional preventative guidelines.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV cannot usually be transmitted sexually. Nevertheless, even if sexual transmission is very uncommon, practices involving blood contact should be considered <em>at risk</em> behaviors. Having a sexually transmitted disease or HIV, having sex with multiple partners, or engaging in rough sex appears to increase a person’s risk of getting Hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Sharing razors and toothbrushes can expose an individual to infection as well.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Still, about 1 out of 4 patients does not know how or when he or she was infected.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a><sup><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"></a></sup></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">People who have recovered from acute hepatitis C and those who have been cured must be careful about prevention, since reinfection is possible.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is as yet, no proven vaccine for HCV.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">6.<strong><a name="sec6"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Why don’t we have a vaccine for HCV?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A vaccine contains a biological agent that is usually an attenuated or replication-deficient version of a disease causing organism. Exposure to this agent will safely stimulate an individual’s immune system to acquire an immunity to the microorganism without causing disease. HCV is a difficult virus to produce a vaccine for because of its genetic diversity. As such, it is a challenge for scientists to find a target on the virus that is common across HCV genotypes and subgenotypes.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In contrast, HBV is easily recognized by the protein called Antigen Australia (HBsAg), and an immunological response against HbsAg can stop the infection, but researchers have not yet found such a promising target in the structure of HCV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The first vaccine for HCV to reach clinical trials was found to be safe and produced a good immune response in the 15 healthy human volunteers who took part in the phase 1 safety trial. Its efficacy is currently under investigation among intravenous drug users in two sites in the USA. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">7.<strong><a name="sec7"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Can blood transfusions still transmit HCV today?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In developed countries<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a>, the first blood test for HCV was introduced in 1990. This test could detect antibodies against HCV proteins. In the USA, screening blood from donors with this HCV test decreased the risk of transfusion-associated HCV infection per unit of blood from 0.36% (1 in 274) to 0.07% (1 in 3300). Today it is estimated that this test has prevented transmission of HCV to 40,000 patients per year in the US. This test wasn’t perfect. Antibodies to HCV weren’t detectable in the blood for at least 12 weeks after infection, and sometimes more than 26 weeks. During this window, tainted blood could therefore appear safe.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A second-generation more sensitive test, able to detect infected blood as early as 10-20 days post infection, was developed and approved in 1992 . It is estimated that this new test prevented an additional 13,000 people from becoming infected with HCV each year.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/history-of-postransfusion-hep.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2058 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/history-of-postransfusion-hep.jpg" alt="history of postransfusion hep" width="567" height="454" /></a></span>Globally<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a>, blood transfusions are not yet as safe as they are in higher-income countries. Of 148 countries that provided WHO data for screening, 41 reported that they lacked the resources to screen all donated blood for one or more of the required transfusion-transmitted diseases (HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In sub-Saharan Africa, 28 out of the 40 countries have yet to implement national quality systems needed to assure effective screening of donated blood. WHO estimates that the lack of effective screening results in up to 5 million new infections of hepatitis C every year in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">8.<strong><a name="sec8"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are the challenges of HCV prevention in lower income countries?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The transmission of hepatitis C persists in most parts of Africa, as well as in other parts of the world, primarily because of traditional habits and a lack of resources in healthcare settings.</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h3Z8DuJnwWM?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> 9.<strong><a name="sec9"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are HCV genotypes, how many strains do we know and how common are they?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There are 7 main genotypes of Hepatitis C . These differences are based on major viral genetic characteristics, i.e. differences in the genetic sequence that may affect functional features of the virus and how it will respond to pharmacological treatments or antiviral drugs like interferon.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Other, more minor, variants can be found within each genotype; HCV is further classified into 67 confirmed and 20 provisional subtypes. The genetic differences between subtypes are more subtle, but these still need to be considered since these can sometimes influence the virus’s response to different kinds of treatments . In genotype 1, for example, the difference between genotype 1a and 1b is relevant in terms of anticipated treatment response and must therefore be assessed before initiating treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The high degree of genetic diversity of HCV continues to pose a significant challenge for achieving successful vaccines and drug therapies that are effective for all genotypes and subtypes, the so-called pan-genotypic treatment. Such an option would be of particularinterest in developing countries, where genotype testing is often unreliable or difficult to perform.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/most-common-genotypes.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2062 alignnone" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/most-common-genotypes-300x188.jpg" alt="most common genotypes" width="450" height="282" /></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some current treatments are said to be pan-genotypic, but in the real world they have different degrees of effectiveness for different genotypes and are not approved for all of them (<em>see</em> treatment module). Doses, length of treatment, and rate of success still partly depend on HCV genotype, and sometimes subtype. Alternative drugs with broader efficacy are currently under investigation.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is possible for a person to be infected with more than one genotype.</p>\r\n<p class="alignleft" style="text-align: justify;">Globally, the most common genotype is G1 (42% of all HCV cases), followed by G3 (26%) and G4 (17%). The most common subtype is 1b (27%).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Global distribution of different genotypes shows different prevalence in different areas of the world.</p>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence-map_genotypes.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2063 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence-map_genotypes.jpg" alt="prevalence map_genotypes" width="950" height="404" /></a><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Map taken from Messina et al, 2014 (Fig 1A)</strong></span>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Genotype 1 (subtype 1b), is the most prevalent genotype in higher income countries, followed by genotype 3.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The global distribution of HCV genetic variation could be related to historical and contemporary trends in human migration. For example, strains from West Africa (genotype 2) could have been brought to the Americas through the trans-Atlantic slave trade.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One possible explanation for the global distribution of genotype 1 is its association with the most common cause of HCV infection in the 20th century — the distribution of contaminated blood and blood products before HCV screening of blood began. In fact, genotype 1 is prevalent in developed countries, where blood transfusions were more available and widespread: a hypothesis is that the most common sources of blood in those years were from areas where this genotype was prevalent.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The global dissemination of genotype 3 is more likely to be attributed to the association of subtype 3a with injection drug use and to population migration in United Kingdom during colonialism from countries where subtype 3a is dominant, such as India and Pakistan.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if genotype 1 and 3 infections are more prevalent than all other genotypes globally. Genotypes found more commonly in lower-income countries still account for a significant proportion of HCV cases worldwide. Specifically, genotype 2 is most frequent in West Africa and parts of South America (the latter likely reflecting population movements resulting from the trans-Atlantic slave trade), while genotypes 4 and 6 are common in Central/North Africa and East/Southeast Asia, respectively.</p>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/be-aware-box_1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2070 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/be-aware-box_1.jpg" alt="be aware box_1" width="1205" height="378" /></a>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">10.<strong><a name="sec10"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are the symptoms of hepatitis C?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Most people with hepatitis C do not have symptoms and do not know they are infected until their liver has sustained significant damage.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A chronic viral hepatitis infection can present without any symptoms for decades.\r\nHowever, it is possible to experience the following symptoms:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>feeling unusually tired all the time</li>\r\n	<li>depression</li>\r\n	<li>jaundice</li>\r\n	<li>a general sense of feeling unwell</li>\r\n	<li>abdominal pain or bloating</li>\r\n	<li>loss of memory</li>\r\n	<li>itchy skin</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Since these symptoms are very vague, and similar to those reported in many other common diseases, people are often unaware of their condition until they develop cirrhosis, when scar tissue replaces healthy tissue in the liver and prevents the liver from working properly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The early stages of cirrhosis can be as insidious as the previous phases, with very few or no symptoms experienced by the individual, but as the liver loses its ability to function properly, a loss of appetite, nausea and itchy skin become more and more common.\r\nAs the disease progresses, and liver functions are affected, many new symptoms tend to develop:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">weight loss and muscle wasting</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">tenderness or pain around the liver area</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">blood capillaries on the skin above waist level</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">a tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequent nosebleeds or bleeding gums</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">hair loss</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">fever and shivering attacks</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">swelling in the legs, ankles and feet due to a build-up of fluid (edema)</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">swelling in abdomen, due to a build-up of fluid known as ascites</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Changes in personality, insomnia, memory loss, confusion and difficulty concentrating are caused by an encephalopathy that can occur when toxins affect the brain, because the liver is unable to remove them from the body.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">11.<span style="color: #3366ff;">How often does the disease progress into a chronic infection and what happens to the liver?</span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the WHO, at least 15% of infected persons spontaneously clear the virus within 6 months of infection, without any treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The remaining 55–85% of persons will develop a chronic HCV infection. When chronic Hepatitis C develops, it can result in long-term health problems, including liver damage, liver failure, liver cancer, and even death.\r\nOf those with chronic HCV infection, the risk of cirrhosis of the liver is 15–30% within 20 years.\r\nChronic hepatitis C is the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer and the most common reason for liver transplantation in the United States.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">For every 100 persons infected with HCV, approximately 1–5 will die from the consequences of chronic infection (liver cancer or cirrhosis) (source CDC).</p>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/z_liver-damage_timeline_1-flat-small.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2036 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/z_liver-damage_timeline_1-flat-small.jpg" alt="liver damage_timeline_final" width="2508" height="1751" /></a>\r\n\r\nbased on http://www.hepatitisc.uw.edu/go/evaluation-staging-monitoring/natural-history/core-concept/all\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCyoHQ-KKaw?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> 12.<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">How can Hepatitis C be diagnosed?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In most cases infection is identified when the patient is screened for blood donation or when elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT, a liver enzyme) levels are detected during routine medical exams.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When HCV infection is suspected, a blood test is performed to search for antibodies against HCV. If the test detects the presence of antibodies, a second test is performed to directly establish whether the virus itself is currently present in the individual.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/org-chart_good-one2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2279 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/org-chart_good-one2.jpg" alt="org chart_good one2" width="907" height="2750" /></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">...</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9S1ycVi9gA?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C is based on the detection of both anti-HCV antibodies and direct detection of the HCV virus in the presence of biological (i.e. abnormal levels of liver enzymes in blood tests) or histological (that can be seen examining small parts of liver tissue taken by biopsy) signs of chronic hepatitis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Having anti-HCV antibodies (anti-HCV positive) in blood does not necessarily mean that an individual has an active hepatitis C infection. The presence of antibodies is an indication that a person has at some point in the past mounted an immune response againt HCV. Approximately 20% of the infected people clear the virus within 6 months, and these individuals will continue to carry antibodies againt HCV. Anti-HCV-positive, HCV RNA negative individuals should be retested for HCV RNA three months later to confirm true convalescence. After that, they are not considered to have hepatitis C. Although no longer infected, they will still test positive for anti-HCV antibodies all their lives. Since they don’t host the virus in their blood, they cannot spread the disease.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the presence of both anti-HCV antibodies and the HCV virus in blood indicates the presence of a hepatitis C infection and, consequently, that the person is infectious. If the direct HCV test is negative within 6 months, the patient had acute hepatitis C. If the test continues to yield positive results beyond 6 months, the patient is diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">After that time, it is very rare for the immune system to clear the virus and for the test to be negative.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, HCV antibodies are not protective against reinfection, which can occur after successful treatment as well (See <em>Treatment</em> module for more information).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2283 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2.jpg" alt="Table 2" width="2033" height="556" /></a>A laboratory test for identifying the genotype (and 1a/1b subtype) of the hepatitis C strain and an assessment of liver damage will guide treatment choices.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Establishing the amount of virus present, or the “viral load” can also help predict a treatment’s success.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A test of the patient’s DNA can help determine how effective certain drugs can be against HCV. Variants of a gene involved in the immune response against HCV (Interleukin 28B, IL28B), can alter the effect of certain HCV treatments (See Treatment module).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">13.<span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff;" name="sec13"></a>How can liver damage be assessed?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main factors influencing the type and timing of treatment is the severity of liver disease.\r\nPatients with cirrhosis have to be identified since their treatment regimen needs to be adapted accordingly. The fibrosis stage can be assessed initially with imaging (ultrasound scan, MRI,…), liver stiffness measurement, and identification of biomarkers in the blood.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Liver stiffness measurement (FibroScan®) measures how quickly vibrations pass through the liver. The more ‘stiff’ or damaged the liver is, the more quickly the waves will pass through it .</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Blood biomarkers include several direct markers which correlate with, or are part of, the liver matrix that is produced in the fibrosis process. Other indirect markers reflect changes in liver function. They are molecules released into the blood when there is inflammation of the liver.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Both stiffness measurement and biomarkers can distinguish quite well between cirrhosis and no-fibrosis. Combined, these tests can identify intermediate degrees of fibrosis. These tests reduce the need for an invasive liver biopsy, a procedure that can be problematic for patients with impaired blood clotting capacity.\r\nIn patients without compromised blood clotting, there is little risk of hemorrage from a liver biopsy, since it involves taking a small tissue sample from the liver though the skin by percutaneous core needle, under ultrasound guide. This tissue sample is then examined under a microscope.</p>\r\n14.<strong><a name="sec14"></a> How is Hepatitis C treated and managed?</strong>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When a diagnosis of Hepatitis C is confirmed, the presence or absence of other diseases must be established since this can influence prognosis and treatment. Mycotoxins, as well as alcohol, can make the evolution of the disease more severe. A concurrent infection with HIV, for example, can require a different approach with different drugs, and possible drug interactions must also be considered.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The degree of liver damage and virus genotype are used to drive treatment and management of the disease (see treatment module).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A therapy’s success is evaluated by blood tests showing no detectable virus. A sustained virus response (SVR), is the continued absence of detectable HCV virus in the blood six months (24 weeks) after the end of treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The antiviral Interferon-α was the the first drug treatment for HCV after it was discovered in 1989. In 2011, a more persistent form of interferon-α (Pegylated interferon- α), together with the antiviral drug ribavirin, increased the rates of success. These, however, never exceeded a 50% cure rate, and their heavy side effects often forced patients to discontinue the treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2011, new antivirals called Direct Agent Antivirals (DAA, i.e. protease inhibitors acting directly on the virus instead of on the patient) were introduced, to be given in association with previous drugs (triple therapy regimen). They improved the SVR in up to 75% of patients, but with even worse side effects.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All these therapies were more effective on other genotypes than on genotype 1, the most common in higher income countries. Substantial research efforts led to a new class of DAA. The first to be introduced was sofosbuvir in 2014. The new therapies are even more effective on genotype 1 than on others, approaching 95% of success rates in clinical trials with fewer and milder side effects.\r\nNow, the real challenge is providing access to these revolutionary drugs (please refer to Treatment section for success rates of the DAA in other genotypes). They are very expensive and on a global scale most healthcare systems and patients cannot afford them.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This has made hepatitis C therapy more a policy issue than a medical one.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9S1ycVi9gA?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>REFERENCES</strong>\r\n\r\nPrati, D.

Doctors have known about HCV – or, as it was long known, non-A non-B hepatitis - for years, but it was believed to be less problematic than its better known viral cousins, hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Besides, there were other, more formidable, infectious disease challenges that came along, like AIDS, that pre-occupied public health officials and politicians. But quietly, over time, scientific knowledge of hepatitis C grew and, along with it, the sobering realization that it is one of the world’s biggest killers, claiming as many lives as hepatitis B, and even more than malaria.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But, unlike other forms of viral hepatitis, there are effective treatments for HCV, and that means many of the estimated 700,000 deaths the disease claims annually are preventable – at least in theory. These treatments come at a high price and good data are lacking on how many are truly infected on a global scale, and who would benefit most from treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Medicine, however, is only part of the story. HCV is a political and public health challenge on a global scale and, to come to grips with it, we must address many questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">How HCV has become a public health crisis.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">What is the best public health response to the epidemic?</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Who should be screened, and how?</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">The challenges around treatment beyond cost.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThis section will focus on these issues and more, providing fodder for inquisitive journalists.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2.<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"> The Unseen Epidemic: events behind the HCV crisis</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The role of public health is to protect and improve the health of the population, not just individuals. Prevention and health promotion initiatives help routine challenges, such as the spread of infectious diseases, from developing into crises. However, public health officials rarely have the final say on priority-setting, adoption of specific strategies, or how much money will be allocated to the response. That belongs to politicians, and they may accept, ignore, or even go against expert advice, for a host of economic or political reasons.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">How to respond to hepatitis C proved to be a major challenge for public health experts and policy-makers. At first, they had little solid information to guide their response. While scientists had known since the mid-70s that there was a variant of hepatitis that was neither A nor B, they could not pinpoint it. There was no test to detect it and no vaccine to prevent it. They also assumed, quite reasonably that the virus was not that big of a deal because few people fell acutely ill. They would realize only later that the virus gnawed away slowly at the liver and caused grave conditions like liver cancer and cirrhosis decades later.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV was finally given a proper name in 1989, when the virus was discovered. Soon after, an antibody test was developed to screen blood for the virus, and public health officials and regulators began the process of creating blood screening strategies. It was believed that this would help contain the spread of the virus. However, at the time, whether this was necessary was a matter of debate. HCV was seen as a small-scale problem, causing only minor manifestations in relatively few patients, many of whom were believed to clear the infection after the initial symptoms. No one knew HCV caused chronic infections or that carriers of the virus were able to infect others even when they had no obvious signs of illness.</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZouPfK_E2j0?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As the global impact of HCV has become apparent, the World Health Assembly - WHO’s governing body - has adopted a number of resolutions. In 2011, July 28 was officially recognized as World Hepatitis Day - to create awareness, strengthen prevention and coordinate a global response. A Global Hepatitis Program has also been set up within the WHO to set standards and issue guidelines to help countries formulate specific hepatitis policies for prevention and treatment.</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-lyEJQYBnDM?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHepatitis C had little profile as a public health issue because was it was thought to be a problem mainly confined to intravenous drug users.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ywPfw-vhEM?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> As screening increased, it was discovered that out of the approximately 150 million individuals living with chronic hepatitis C only some 10 million got it through injection drug use. The vast majority contracted the virus via contact with the health system, through blood transfusions, unsafe injections and other health care exposures with poor infection control practices.</p>\r\n <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4i2tHXkX_lE?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\nAnother factor contributing to the crisis might possibly be doctors themselves.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qT_B_pb0XTo?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<h2> <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">3.</span> P for Public Health: Protection - Prevention - Promotion - Prognosis - Provision</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The role of public health</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Public Health tools for handling HCV could include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li><strong>Surveillance and patient screening</strong>:\r\nmonitoring national prevalence (number of total cases) and incidence (number of new cases in a given period of time) of the virus, identifying asymptomatic chronic carriers, following these patients to determine when to provide treatment and making sure they adhere to the prescribed regimen</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Education:</strong>\r\ndisseminating information to the public and health professionals about the disease, risk factors, how to avoid infection, etc. on a regular basis and with a special effort on national and community level to mark World Hepatitis Day on July 28\r\ninitiating health education and training to reduce risk of transmission during exposures in nonmedical (e.g., commercial barbering, body piercing, tattoos, and traditional circumcision) and occupational (e.g., health care and sanitation worker) settings.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Testing Blood products</strong>:\r\ntesting all blood used for transfusions and blood products\r\nvirus inactivation (heat-treatment) of plasma-derived products\r\nencouraging the use of as little transfusion blood as possible</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Infection-Control</strong>:\r\nenforcing infection control practices\r\nencouraging the use of therapeutic syringes with features to prevent reuse and injuries as well as safe handling and disposal of sharps and waste\r\nencouraging adequate sterilization of reusable material such as surgical or dental instruments</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Counseling:</strong>\r\npeople with chronic, asymptomatic HCV\r\nincluding teaching them not to share toothbrushes and razors with others and to let their dentist and other medical workers know of their infection status, giving these individuals the opportunity to protect themselves appropriately</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Harm Reduction</strong>:\r\ninitiating harm reduction programs, with counseling, needle-syringe exchange and opiate substitution therapy for injection drug users</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However resources are limited, and as a result, political prioritization guides public health decisions. Public health may make recommendations, but whether or not these recommendations will be acted upon is something that will be determined at the political level. Therefore it is important to understand that there is public health and there are politics and these are not always aligned.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>This is also fertile ground for journalism</em>: to document and explore the discrepancies between promises and action.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventing the spread of HCV does not require reinventing the wheel. Many of these strategies are already used to prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS: the screening of donor blood and blood products, universal infection control practices, education, and harm reduction. A number of the steps that have been used against HIV/AIDS likely helped curb the spread of HCV because they have similar routes of transmission and there is some co-infection.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, HCV can stay active outside the human body much longer than HIV. Consequently, infection control practices (e.g., hand-washing, sterilization of reusable medical equipment, and cleaning of surfaces) have to be even stricter for HCV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All the HIV/AIDS prevention efforts never managed to curtail one significant contributor to the spread of blood-borne infections in low- and middle-income countries: unnecessary injections. In Egypt, where there is a generalized HCV epidemic, the prevalence is highest in people with ongoing or a past history of medical injections. It will require determined education efforts to change the practice of re-using needles for vaccinations and other procedures.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, what is needed most fundamentally to prevent the spread of infectious diseases like hepatitis C is a well-functioning and well-staffed healthcare system – something that does not exist in many countries - along with political will, a willingness to invest in safer healthcare.</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YV2zVQC5-z0?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Many countries have only applied a few of the public health tools against HCV. Is that an option?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As most chronic patients are asymptomatic it might seem easy to ignore the disease, but there can be serious impacts on a community or a country’s health care resources. If a large group of individuals begins to exhibit liver disease within the same time frame, as expected in this case, then governments will indeed be faced with an acute problem. What course of action politicians decide to take determines the outcome of this public health issue.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of instituting sound health policies can slow their adoption. For example, when a blood test for HCV became available in the early 1990s, some countries were slow to incorporate it as part of the regular screening of blood in hospitals as they had already spent a considerable amount in the 1980s to set up screening for HIV/AIDS.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Even before HCV was identified in 1989 it was known that a non-A, non-B hepatitis was circulating in the blood supply. It is estimated that in the 1970s in the U.S., the risk of contracting hepatitis from blood-transfusion was as high as 30 per cent. Thanks to screening of donor blood, that risk dropped to almost zero by the year 2000.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WsB0L7KqU18?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Questions worth asking:</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Overuse of (unnecessary) injections with unsterile equipment seems to be a driver in spreading the virus, seen not only in Egypt, but in many low- and middle-income countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Can education counter the popular belief that injections works against most everything?</em></li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to make sure that the needle being used in a medical procedure was sterile?</em></li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to make sure that the needle being used for an injection in a market stall was sterile?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A key question that was asked in country after country with regard to tainted blood and HIV/AIDS could also be applied to HCV:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Did public health do enough and in time to curb the spread of non-A, non-B hepatitis? Or did they opt to do nothing to save money?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<h2> 4. <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">The unknowingly infected</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Screening Strategies: How to find those who are infected and do not know it?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>A large number of people infected with HCV are ‛silent carriers‛ - meaning they show no symptoms for years, even decades. How can they be identified? And should they be identified if the resources </em><em>treat them are lacking</em><em>? </em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Universal screening – testing everyone systematically for HCV – is one approach, at least in theory. But, in most countries that is not practical, nor fiscally responsible, given all the other health priorities. Besides, a screening test only confirms past exposure to the virus. That would need to be followed up with other more costly tests that 1) confirm the continued presence of the virus circulating in the blood, and in what amounts, and 2) determine the degree damage to the liver. It is a cascade of testing that can quickly become very costly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ideally, what researchers would like to see is a single, inexpensive blood or serology test that provides all the relevant information. But a test like that is currently only a dream.</p>\r\n<em>If you rule out universal screening, you then move to selective screening of high-risk groups. But who do you target first?</em>\r\n\r\nIn the U.S. and Canada, systematic screening of all Baby Boomers is recommended – specifically everyone born between 1945 and 1965 in the U.S. and 1945 to 1975 in Canada.\r\n\r\nThis demographic group is singled out because they are at significant risk of having been exposed to tainted blood through a transfusion, through the sharing of needles and unprotected sex. Because HCV infection often takes decades to have serious health impacts – like cirrhosis and liver cancer – this group is also most likely to suffer health impacts.\r\n\r\nInjection drug users and prisoners are also obvious targets for screening, as are blood donors who are rejected because they have one or more risk factors. But it cannot be forgotten that a significant proportion of HCV carriers – as many as one in four – have no obvious risk factors. Many countries are also adding hepatitis C to the current panel of screening tests done on pregnant women, in the hope they can prevent the virus from being passed on from mother-to-child.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7sKLcICED7Q?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It should be noted, however, that a number of countries, such as the Scandinavian nations, have made a decision to not screen for hepatitis C. Their reasoning is that the incidence of HCV - the number of new cases - has been close to zero for the past 20 years and that the rare cases found are usually imported, i.e. they would not be found by screening residents of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Testing is fraught with ethical questions.</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on present knowledge, roughly 70 per cent of those infected will probably not develop serious complications as a result of their infection. However, the test in itself cannot determine whether a patient will be among the 30 per cent who will develop a life-threatening liver disease. In addition, it is not known whether the 70/30 division will hold up over the long term. Only time will tell.</p>\r\nCurrent treatment protocols call for offering treatment first to patients showing the effects of chronic HCV infection, because it is believed they are most likely to develop cirrhosis or liver cancer. But how do you reassure the other 70 per cent, the people who know they are infected but have no obvious illness? Will they be satisfied with simply being monitored, knowing they too could fall ill down the road?\r\n\r\n<span style="color: #000000;">The key ethical question is whether you should actually test broadly if the resources do not exist to treat and care for everyone who has been identified as a carrier.</span>\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DmRaC6BsURc?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But it could also be argued that even if there is no promise of treatment, it would still be valuable to know whether you are infected. Because of the preventive steps you can take, like drinking less alcohol, and reducing the stress on the liver. Or being careful not to infect others (e.g., not sharing toothbrushes or razors with others, informing dentists and health care workers of infection status).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If treatment is unavailable, should people be informed that they are infected with a virus that could potentially cause cancer? Is it unethical to withhold that information?</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3QAP8fdq5X4?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Once identified, what next?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis C is a resource-intensive disease that many health systems will find hard to manage. A strong health system is required, and the ever-growing case load can potentially overwhelm even well-endowed systems.</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_s6bDMbzmQ?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\nOne way low- and middle income countries have dealt with the crush burden of HIV/AIDS, has been to establish a parallel health system, caring only for patient with that condition. Could that approach, called “vertical programs,” also work for hepatitis C? And does this offering of specialized care strengthen or weaken the overall health system? The experience that countries in West Africa lived with the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak is that this approach may be counter-productive, leaving the rest of the system weak and vulnerable to new challenges. Ideally, investing in programs to treat diseases like HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C should be done in a manner that bolsters the system overall.\r\n\r\nThe countries that do have a hepatitis policy usually have well-functioning health systems in place to build on, to integrate hepatitis into what already exists.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B1T4XcjX24c?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to note, however, that the expertise that has been built up in the HIV/AIDS programs could also be used to manage viral hepatitis, especially given the fact that the burden of HIV/AIDS is falling, and that of HCV is growing.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Do countries need a specific hepatitis policy?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It depends, as often is the case, on the local settings.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If the health system has the capacity and the resources to treat and follow a patient with chronic hepatitis like they would treat and follow up any other patient, then probably not.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If the health system does not have that capacity, then a plan, based on know-how from WHO‛s Global Hepatitis Program may be a good idea, because it will tell what to do and in which order. Also it can be a tool for accountability, to make sure things are being done.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The accumulated case load is again the obstacle. Dealing with a crisis usually comes at a cost, financial and managerial, somewhere else in the system. Most, maybe all, health systems don’t run with funds and personnel to spare. Budgets and resources are limited, even in the strongest, most developed and well-resourced health systems. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa, so overwhelmed Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, that even with foreign assistance, other serious health problems could not be addressed; maternal health, malaria, vaccinations, as well as many emergency rooms were severely affected. Even high income countries may run into problems caused by a surge in need for a particular treatment or test. After beginning to offer screening for colorectal cancers to all persons between the ages of 50-74 years, the healthcare system in Denmark witnessed an unexpected increase in waiting lists―so many more patients than anticipated needed follow-up colonoscopies that a number of hospital units could not keep up, despite having had years to prepare for the roll out of the screening program.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Other questions to ask:</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Doctors decide, based on guidelines, which patients receive treatment first.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How are patients told they are not yet eligible for treatment?

But they offer great promise – the real possibility of cure for many HCV carriers, and preventing a countless number of future infections.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">How drugs are priced, the profits they generate and the benefits they confer are the subject of much debate, and nowhere more so than when it comes to hepatitis C, because of the tremendous numbers of people infected.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some believe the price the pharmaceutical companies are asking for new drugs like Harvoni are based on what they can extract from governments and insurance companies rather than actual costs plus a reasonable return. Companies argue that the cost of research and development are astronomical and the drugs, while highly-priced, are a good investment because of the benefits to sufferers and the future HCV cases that will be prevented.</p>\r\nIn reality, we often don’t know the actual price paid, because list prices vary by country, and insurance plans, private and public, negotiate discounts.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CyomWClUeGk?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\nWith HIV/AIDS drugs, these tiered pricing schemes, and agreements signed with generic companies have brought prices down markedly and made treatment available to millions.\r\n\r\nWill the same thing happen with hepatitis C drugs?\r\n\r\nWe don’t know.\r\n\r\nWhat is known is that strong advocacy and the involvement of high-profile global health groups like The Global Fund, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Clinton Foundation created tremendous pressure to find solutions. Hepatitis C does not have that profile and the backing of people with star power – at least not yet.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wZVs9zImIBQ?feature=oembed&amp;start=2" width="604" height="340" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Who to treat and follow up?</em>\r\n\r\nCurrent European and American guidelines do not recommend treating all those who test positive as soon as they are found. Most infected are asymptomatic for years and considered in no urgent need of treatment. Giving the medication too early may cause more harm than benefit.\r\n\r\nBased on the progression of disease, the physician will decide when to start the treatment. However, there is no universal agreement on when that time is.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ptks9wMhJXY?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment rids the body of the hepatitis C virus, but it does not eliminate or reverse liver disease. So the word “cure” is a bit misleading. Still, if the progression of disease can be halted, there should be less liver disease in the future, and that holds out the promise of drastically reducing the need for liver transplants, a very costly procedure. But reaping those savings in some distant future comes with a heavy price in the here and now. Today, health care systems are hit twice - they have to pay for the treatment as well as for liver transplants for those who have had chronic infection. To those already in need of a new liver the cure has come too late.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> <em>Will lowering the price of the drugs solve all problems? </em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Not necessarily. Of course it will make the drugs more accessible, but some of the bottlenecks in the system will remain, even if the drugs were available for free.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the first hurdles to overcome is having the drug registered within every country in which it is going to be used. The pharmaceutical company holding the rights to a product may not want to register it, because it will be too costly compared to what they can expect to earn. A generic manufacturer may also have concerns, because a generic drug has to be prequalified by the WHO, which is also costly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment involves testing, and tests have a price as well, not to mention that laboratories and trained personnel are required. Even in the industrialized countries trained personnel are in short supply. There are few physicians who specialize in liver disease, and taking on an extra caseload will be a challenge for them. Health systems do not have the excess capacity.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> <em>Questions worth asking:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Is there a limit to how many new, high priced drugs governments and insurance companies are willing to pay for?</em></li>\r\n	<li><em>Will price be an (overruling) indicator for which patients will be given access to expensive drugs?</em></li>\r\n	<li>Usually pharmaceutical companies use the argument of cost of research, clinical trials, approval, and drug candidates that turned out to be blind end, to justify prices. <em>But once those costs have been recuperated, will prices come down?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<em>Developing stories to keep in mind:</em>\r\n\r\nAt the Millennium Summit at the United Nations in September 2000, world leaders committed to help achieve the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.

Doctors have known about HCV – or, as it was long known, non-A non-B hepatitis - for years, but it was believed to be less problematic than its better known viral cousins, hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Besides, there were other, more formidable, infectious disease challenges that came along, like AIDS, that pre-occupied public health officials and politicians. But quietly, over time, scientific knowledge of hepatitis C grew and, along with it, the sobering realization that it is one of the world’s biggest killers, claiming as many lives as hepatitis B, and even more than malaria.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But, unlike other forms of viral hepatitis, there are effective treatments for HCV, and that means many of the estimated 700,000 deaths the disease claims annually are preventable – at least in theory. These treatments come at a high price and good data are lacking on how many are truly infected on a global scale, and who would benefit most from treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Medicine, however, is only part of the story. HCV is a political and public health challenge on a global scale and, to come to grips with it, we must address many questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">How HCV has become a public health crisis.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">What is the best public health response to the epidemic?</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Who should be screened, and how?</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">The challenges around treatment beyond cost.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThis section will focus on these issues and more, providing fodder for inquisitive journalists.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<h2 name="sec2" style="text-align: justify;">2.<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"> The Unseen Epidemic: events behind the HCV crisis</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The role of public health is to protect and improve the health of the population, not just individuals. Prevention and health promotion initiatives help routine challenges, such as the spread of infectious diseases, from developing into crises. However, public health officials rarely have the final say on priority-setting, adoption of specific strategies, or how much money will be allocated to the response. That belongs to politicians, and they may accept, ignore, or even go against expert advice, for a host of economic or political reasons.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">How to respond to hepatitis C proved to be a major challenge for public health experts and policy-makers. At first, they had little solid information to guide their response. While scientists had known since the mid-70s that there was a variant of hepatitis that was neither A nor B, they could not pinpoint it. There was no test to detect it and no vaccine to prevent it. They also assumed, quite reasonably that the virus was not that big of a deal because few people fell acutely ill. They would realize only later that the virus gnawed away slowly at the liver and caused grave conditions like liver cancer and cirrhosis decades later.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV was finally given a proper name in 1989, when the virus was discovered. Soon after, an antibody test was developed to screen blood for the virus, and public health officials and regulators began the process of creating blood screening strategies. It was believed that this would help contain the spread of the virus. However, at the time, whether this was necessary was a matter of debate. HCV was seen as a small-scale problem, causing only minor manifestations in relatively few patients, many of whom were believed to clear the infection after the initial symptoms. No one knew HCV caused chronic infections or that carriers of the virus were able to infect others even when they had no obvious signs of illness.</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZouPfK_E2j0?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As the global impact of HCV has become apparent, the World Health Assembly - WHO’s governing body - has adopted a number of resolutions. In 2011, July 28 was officially recognized as World Hepatitis Day - to create awareness, strengthen prevention and coordinate a global response. A Global Hepatitis Program has also been set up within the WHO to set standards and issue guidelines to help countries formulate specific hepatitis policies for prevention and treatment.</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-lyEJQYBnDM?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHepatitis C had little profile as a public health issue because was it was thought to be a problem mainly confined to intravenous drug users.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ywPfw-vhEM?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> As screening increased, it was discovered that out of the approximately 150 million individuals living with chronic hepatitis C only some 10 million got it through injection drug use. The vast majority contracted the virus via contact with the health system, through blood transfusions, unsafe injections and other health care exposures with poor infection control practices.</p>\r\n <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4i2tHXkX_lE?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\nAnother factor contributing to the crisis might possibly be doctors themselves.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qT_B_pb0XTo?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<h2 name="sec3"> <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">3.</span> P for Public Health: Protection - Prevention - Promotion - Prognosis - Provision</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The role of public health</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Public Health tools for handling HCV could include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li><strong>Surveillance and patient screening</strong>:\r\nmonitoring national prevalence (number of total cases) and incidence (number of new cases in a given period of time) of the virus, identifying asymptomatic chronic carriers, following these patients to determine when to provide treatment and making sure they adhere to the prescribed regimen</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Education:</strong>\r\ndisseminating information to the public and health professionals about the disease, risk factors, how to avoid infection, etc. on a regular basis and with a special effort on national and community level to mark World Hepatitis Day on July 28\r\ninitiating health education and training to reduce risk of transmission during exposures in nonmedical (e.g., commercial barbering, body piercing, tattoos, and traditional circumcision) and occupational (e.g., health care and sanitation worker) settings.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Testing Blood products</strong>:\r\ntesting all blood used for transfusions and blood products\r\nvirus inactivation (heat-treatment) of plasma-derived products\r\nencouraging the use of as little transfusion blood as possible</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Infection-Control</strong>:\r\nenforcing infection control practices\r\nencouraging the use of therapeutic syringes with features to prevent reuse and injuries as well as safe handling and disposal of sharps and waste\r\nencouraging adequate sterilization of reusable material such as surgical or dental instruments</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Counseling:</strong>\r\npeople with chronic, asymptomatic HCV\r\nincluding teaching them not to share toothbrushes and razors with others and to let their dentist and other medical workers know of their infection status, giving these individuals the opportunity to protect themselves appropriately</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Harm Reduction</strong>:\r\ninitiating harm reduction programs, with counseling, needle-syringe exchange and opiate substitution therapy for injection drug users</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However resources are limited, and as a result, political prioritization guides public health decisions. Public health may make recommendations, but whether or not these recommendations will be acted upon is something that will be determined at the political level. Therefore it is important to understand that there is public health and there are politics and these are not always aligned.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>This is also fertile ground for journalism</em>: to document and explore the discrepancies between promises and action.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventing the spread of HCV does not require reinventing the wheel. Many of these strategies are already used to prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS: the screening of donor blood and blood products, universal infection control practices, education, and harm reduction. A number of the steps that have been used against HIV/AIDS likely helped curb the spread of HCV because they have similar routes of transmission and there is some co-infection.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, HCV can stay active outside the human body much longer than HIV. Consequently, infection control practices (e.g., hand-washing, sterilization of reusable medical equipment, and cleaning of surfaces) have to be even stricter for HCV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All the HIV/AIDS prevention efforts never managed to curtail one significant contributor to the spread of blood-borne infections in low- and middle-income countries: unnecessary injections. In Egypt, where there is a generalized HCV epidemic, the prevalence is highest in people with ongoing or a past history of medical injections. It will require determined education efforts to change the practice of re-using needles for vaccinations and other procedures.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, what is needed most fundamentally to prevent the spread of infectious diseases like hepatitis C is a well-functioning and well-staffed healthcare system – something that does not exist in many countries - along with political will, a willingness to invest in safer healthcare.</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YV2zVQC5-z0?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Many countries have only applied a few of the public health tools against HCV. Is that an option?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As most chronic patients are asymptomatic it might seem easy to ignore the disease, but there can be serious impacts on a community or a country’s health care resources. If a large group of individuals begins to exhibit liver disease within the same time frame, as expected in this case, then governments will indeed be faced with an acute problem. What course of action politicians decide to take determines the outcome of this public health issue.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of instituting sound health policies can slow their adoption. For example, when a blood test for HCV became available in the early 1990s, some countries were slow to incorporate it as part of the regular screening of blood in hospitals as they had already spent a considerable amount in the 1980s to set up screening for HIV/AIDS.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Even before HCV was identified in 1989 it was known that a non-A, non-B hepatitis was circulating in the blood supply. It is estimated that in the 1970s in the U.S., the risk of contracting hepatitis from blood-transfusion was as high as 30 per cent. Thanks to screening of donor blood, that risk dropped to almost zero by the year 2000.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WsB0L7KqU18?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Questions worth asking:</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Overuse of (unnecessary) injections with unsterile equipment seems to be a driver in spreading the virus, seen not only in Egypt, but in many low- and middle-income countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Can education counter the popular belief that injections works against most everything?</em></li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to make sure that the needle being used in a medical procedure was sterile?</em></li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to make sure that the needle being used for an injection in a market stall was sterile?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A key question that was asked in country after country with regard to tainted blood and HIV/AIDS could also be applied to HCV:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Did public health do enough and in time to curb the spread of non-A, non-B hepatitis? Or did they opt to do nothing to save money?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<h2 name="sec4"> 4. <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">The unknowingly infected</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Screening Strategies: How to find those who are infected and do not know it?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>A large number of people infected with HCV are ‛silent carriers‛ - meaning they show no symptoms for years, even decades. How can they be identified? And should they be identified if the resources </em><em>treat them are lacking</em><em>? </em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Universal screening – testing everyone systematically for HCV – is one approach, at least in theory. But, in most countries that is not practical, nor fiscally responsible, given all the other health priorities. Besides, a screening test only confirms past exposure to the virus. That would need to be followed up with other more costly tests that 1) confirm the continued presence of the virus circulating in the blood, and in what amounts, and 2) determine the degree damage to the liver. It is a cascade of testing that can quickly become very costly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ideally, what researchers would like to see is a single, inexpensive blood or serology test that provides all the relevant information. But a test like that is currently only a dream.</p>\r\n<em>If you rule out universal screening, you then move to selective screening of high-risk groups. But who do you target first?</em>\r\n\r\nIn the U.S. and Canada, systematic screening of all Baby Boomers is recommended – specifically everyone born between 1945 and 1965 in the U.S. and 1945 to 1975 in Canada.\r\n\r\nThis demographic group is singled out because they are at significant risk of having been exposed to tainted blood through a transfusion, through the sharing of needles and unprotected sex. Because HCV infection often takes decades to have serious health impacts – like cirrhosis and liver cancer – this group is also most likely to suffer health impacts.\r\n\r\nInjection drug users and prisoners are also obvious targets for screening, as are blood donors who are rejected because they have one or more risk factors. But it cannot be forgotten that a significant proportion of HCV carriers – as many as one in four – have no obvious risk factors. Many countries are also adding hepatitis C to the current panel of screening tests done on pregnant women, in the hope they can prevent the virus from being passed on from mother-to-child.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7sKLcICED7Q?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It should be noted, however, that a number of countries, such as the Scandinavian nations, have made a decision to not screen for hepatitis C. Their reasoning is that the incidence of HCV - the number of new cases - has been close to zero for the past 20 years and that the rare cases found are usually imported, i.e. they would not be found by screening residents of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Testing is fraught with ethical questions.</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on present knowledge, roughly 70 per cent of those infected will probably not develop serious complications as a result of their infection. However, the test in itself cannot determine whether a patient will be among the 30 per cent who will develop a life-threatening liver disease. In addition, it is not known whether the 70/30 division will hold up over the long term. Only time will tell.</p>\r\nCurrent treatment protocols call for offering treatment first to patients showing the effects of chronic HCV infection, because it is believed they are most likely to develop cirrhosis or liver cancer. But how do you reassure the other 70 per cent, the people who know they are infected but have no obvious illness? Will they be satisfied with simply being monitored, knowing they too could fall ill down the road?\r\n\r\n<span style="color: #000000;">The key ethical question is whether you should actually test broadly if the resources do not exist to treat and care for everyone who has been identified as a carrier.</span>\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DmRaC6BsURc?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But it could also be argued that even if there is no promise of treatment, it would still be valuable to know whether you are infected. Because of the preventive steps you can take, like drinking less alcohol, and reducing the stress on the liver. Or being careful not to infect others (e.g., not sharing toothbrushes or razors with others, informing dentists and health care workers of infection status).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If treatment is unavailable, should people be informed that they are infected with a virus that could potentially cause cancer? Is it unethical to withhold that information?</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3QAP8fdq5X4?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Once identified, what next?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis C is a resource-intensive disease that many health systems will find hard to manage. A strong health system is required, and the ever-growing case load can potentially overwhelm even well-endowed systems.</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_s6bDMbzmQ?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\nOne way low- and middle income countries have dealt with the crush burden of HIV/AIDS, has been to establish a parallel health system, caring only for patient with that condition. Could that approach, called “vertical programs,” also work for hepatitis C? And does this offering of specialized care strengthen or weaken the overall health system? The experience that countries in West Africa lived with the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak is that this approach may be counter-productive, leaving the rest of the system weak and vulnerable to new challenges. Ideally, investing in programs to treat diseases like HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C should be done in a manner that bolsters the system overall.\r\n\r\nThe countries that do have a hepatitis policy usually have well-functioning health systems in place to build on, to integrate hepatitis into what already exists.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B1T4XcjX24c?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to note, however, that the expertise that has been built up in the HIV/AIDS programs could also be used to manage viral hepatitis, especially given the fact that the burden of HIV/AIDS is falling, and that of HCV is growing.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Do countries need a specific hepatitis policy?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It depends, as often is the case, on the local settings.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If the health system has the capacity and the resources to treat and follow a patient with chronic hepatitis like they would treat and follow up any other patient, then probably not.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If the health system does not have that capacity, then a plan, based on know-how from WHO‛s Global Hepatitis Program may be a good idea, because it will tell what to do and in which order. Also it can be a tool for accountability, to make sure things are being done.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The accumulated case load is again the obstacle. Dealing with a crisis usually comes at a cost, financial and managerial, somewhere else in the system. Most, maybe all, health systems don’t run with funds and personnel to spare. Budgets and resources are limited, even in the strongest, most developed and well-resourced health systems. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa, so overwhelmed Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, that even with foreign assistance, other serious health problems could not be addressed; maternal health, malaria, vaccinations, as well as many emergency rooms were severely affected. Even high income countries may run into problems caused by a surge in need for a particular treatment or test. After beginning to offer screening for colorectal cancers to all persons between the ages of 50-74 years, the healthcare system in Denmark witnessed an unexpected increase in waiting lists―so many more patients than anticipated needed follow-up colonoscopies that a number of hospital units could not keep up, despite having had years to prepare for the roll out of the screening program.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Other questions to ask:</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Doctors decide, based on guidelines, which patients receive treatment first.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How are patients told they are not yet eligible for treatment?

But they offer great promise – the real possibility of cure for many HCV carriers, and preventing a countless number of future infections.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">How drugs are priced, the profits they generate and the benefits they confer are the subject of much debate, and nowhere more so than when it comes to hepatitis C, because of the tremendous numbers of people infected.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some believe the price the pharmaceutical companies are asking for new drugs like Harvoni are based on what they can extract from governments and insurance companies rather than actual costs plus a reasonable return. Companies argue that the cost of research and development are astronomical and the drugs, while highly-priced, are a good investment because of the benefits to sufferers and the future HCV cases that will be prevented.</p>\r\nIn reality, we often don’t know the actual price paid, because list prices vary by country, and insurance plans, private and public, negotiate discounts.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CyomWClUeGk?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\nWith HIV/AIDS drugs, these tiered pricing schemes, and agreements signed with generic companies have brought prices down markedly and made treatment available to millions.\r\n\r\nWill the same thing happen with hepatitis C drugs?\r\n\r\nWe don’t know.\r\n\r\nWhat is known is that strong advocacy and the involvement of high-profile global health groups like The Global Fund, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Clinton Foundation created tremendous pressure to find solutions. Hepatitis C does not have that profile and the backing of people with star power – at least not yet.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wZVs9zImIBQ?feature=oembed&amp;start=2" width="604" height="340" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Who to treat and follow up?</em>\r\n\r\nCurrent European and American guidelines do not recommend treating all those who test positive as soon as they are found. Most infected are asymptomatic for years and considered in no urgent need of treatment. Giving the medication too early may cause more harm than benefit.\r\n\r\nBased on the progression of disease, the physician will decide when to start the treatment. However, there is no universal agreement on when that time is.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ptks9wMhJXY?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment rids the body of the hepatitis C virus, but it does not eliminate or reverse liver disease. So the word “cure” is a bit misleading. Still, if the progression of disease can be halted, there should be less liver disease in the future, and that holds out the promise of drastically reducing the need for liver transplants, a very costly procedure. But reaping those savings in some distant future comes with a heavy price in the here and now. Today, health care systems are hit twice - they have to pay for the treatment as well as for liver transplants for those who have had chronic infection. To those already in need of a new liver the cure has come too late.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> <em>Will lowering the price of the drugs solve all problems? </em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Not necessarily. Of course it will make the drugs more accessible, but some of the bottlenecks in the system will remain, even if the drugs were available for free.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the first hurdles to overcome is having the drug registered within every country in which it is going to be used. The pharmaceutical company holding the rights to a product may not want to register it, because it will be too costly compared to what they can expect to earn. A generic manufacturer may also have concerns, because a generic drug has to be prequalified by the WHO, which is also costly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment involves testing, and tests have a price as well, not to mention that laboratories and trained personnel are required. Even in the industrialized countries trained personnel are in short supply. There are few physicians who specialize in liver disease, and taking on an extra caseload will be a challenge for them. Health systems do not have the excess capacity.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> <em>Questions worth asking:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Is there a limit to how many new, high priced drugs governments and insurance companies are willing to pay for?</em></li>\r\n	<li><em>Will price be an (overruling) indicator for which patients will be given access to expensive drugs?</em></li>\r\n	<li>Usually pharmaceutical companies use the argument of cost of research, clinical trials, approval, and drug candidates that turned out to be blind end, to justify prices. <em>But once those costs have been recuperated, will prices come down?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<em>Developing stories to keep in mind:</em>\r\n\r\nAt the Millennium Summit at the United Nations in September 2000, world leaders committed to help achieve the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.

Doctors have known about HCV – or, as it was long known, non-A non-B hepatitis - for years, but it was believed to be less problematic than its better known viral cousins, hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Besides, there were other, more formidable, infectious disease challenges that came along, like AIDS, that pre-occupied public health officials and politicians. But quietly, over time, scientific knowledge of hepatitis C grew and, along with it, the sobering realization that it is one of the world’s biggest killers, claiming as many lives as hepatitis B, and even more than malaria.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But, unlike other forms of viral hepatitis, there are effective treatments for HCV, and that means many of the estimated 700,000 deaths the disease claims annually are preventable – at least in theory. These treatments come at a high price and good data are lacking on how many are truly infected on a global scale, and who would benefit most from treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Medicine, however, is only part of the story. HCV is a political and public health challenge on a global scale and, to come to grips with it, we must address many questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">How HCV has become a public health crisis.</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">What is the best public health response to the epidemic?</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">Who should be screened, and how?</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">The challenges around treatment beyond cost.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThis section will focus on these issues and more, providing fodder for inquisitive journalists.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a name="sec2"></a>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2.<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"> The Unseen Epidemic: events behind the HCV crisis</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The role of public health is to protect and improve the health of the population, not just individuals. Prevention and health promotion initiatives help routine challenges, such as the spread of infectious diseases, from developing into crises. However, public health officials rarely have the final say on priority-setting, adoption of specific strategies, or how much money will be allocated to the response. That belongs to politicians, and they may accept, ignore, or even go against expert advice, for a host of economic or political reasons.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">How to respond to hepatitis C proved to be a major challenge for public health experts and policy-makers. At first, they had little solid information to guide their response. While scientists had known since the mid-70s that there was a variant of hepatitis that was neither A nor B, they could not pinpoint it. There was no test to detect it and no vaccine to prevent it. They also assumed, quite reasonably that the virus was not that big of a deal because few people fell acutely ill. They would realize only later that the virus gnawed away slowly at the liver and caused grave conditions like liver cancer and cirrhosis decades later.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV was finally given a proper name in 1989, when the virus was discovered. Soon after, an antibody test was developed to screen blood for the virus, and public health officials and regulators began the process of creating blood screening strategies. It was believed that this would help contain the spread of the virus. However, at the time, whether this was necessary was a matter of debate. HCV was seen as a small-scale problem, causing only minor manifestations in relatively few patients, many of whom were believed to clear the infection after the initial symptoms. No one knew HCV caused chronic infections or that carriers of the virus were able to infect others even when they had no obvious signs of illness.</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZouPfK_E2j0?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As the global impact of HCV has become apparent, the World Health Assembly - WHO’s governing body - has adopted a number of resolutions. In 2011, July 28 was officially recognized as World Hepatitis Day - to create awareness, strengthen prevention and coordinate a global response. A Global Hepatitis Program has also been set up within the WHO to set standards and issue guidelines to help countries formulate specific hepatitis policies for prevention and treatment.</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-lyEJQYBnDM?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHepatitis C had little profile as a public health issue because was it was thought to be a problem mainly confined to intravenous drug users.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ywPfw-vhEM?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> As screening increased, it was discovered that out of the approximately 150 million individuals living with chronic hepatitis C only some 10 million got it through injection drug use. The vast majority contracted the virus via contact with the health system, through blood transfusions, unsafe injections and other health care exposures with poor infection control practices.</p>\r\n <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4i2tHXkX_lE?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\nAnother factor contributing to the crisis might possibly be doctors themselves.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qT_B_pb0XTo?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a name="sec3"></a>\r\n<h2> <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">3.</span> P for Public Health: Protection - Prevention - Promotion - Prognosis - Provision</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The role of public health</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Public Health tools for handling HCV could include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li><strong>Surveillance and patient screening</strong>:\r\nmonitoring national prevalence (number of total cases) and incidence (number of new cases in a given period of time) of the virus, identifying asymptomatic chronic carriers, following these patients to determine when to provide treatment and making sure they adhere to the prescribed regimen</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Education:</strong>\r\ndisseminating information to the public and health professionals about the disease, risk factors, how to avoid infection, etc. on a regular basis and with a special effort on national and community level to mark World Hepatitis Day on July 28\r\ninitiating health education and training to reduce risk of transmission during exposures in nonmedical (e.g., commercial barbering, body piercing, tattoos, and traditional circumcision) and occupational (e.g., health care and sanitation worker) settings.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Testing Blood products</strong>:\r\ntesting all blood used for transfusions and blood products\r\nvirus inactivation (heat-treatment) of plasma-derived products\r\nencouraging the use of as little transfusion blood as possible</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Infection-Control</strong>:\r\nenforcing infection control practices\r\nencouraging the use of therapeutic syringes with features to prevent reuse and injuries as well as safe handling and disposal of sharps and waste\r\nencouraging adequate sterilization of reusable material such as surgical or dental instruments</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Counseling:</strong>\r\npeople with chronic, asymptomatic HCV\r\nincluding teaching them not to share toothbrushes and razors with others and to let their dentist and other medical workers know of their infection status, giving these individuals the opportunity to protect themselves appropriately</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Harm Reduction</strong>:\r\ninitiating harm reduction programs, with counseling, needle-syringe exchange and opiate substitution therapy for injection drug users</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However resources are limited, and as a result, political prioritization guides public health decisions. Public health may make recommendations, but whether or not these recommendations will be acted upon is something that will be determined at the political level. Therefore it is important to understand that there is public health and there are politics and these are not always aligned.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>This is also fertile ground for journalism</em>: to document and explore the discrepancies between promises and action.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventing the spread of HCV does not require reinventing the wheel. Many of these strategies are already used to prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS: the screening of donor blood and blood products, universal infection control practices, education, and harm reduction. A number of the steps that have been used against HIV/AIDS likely helped curb the spread of HCV because they have similar routes of transmission and there is some co-infection.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, HCV can stay active outside the human body much longer than HIV. Consequently, infection control practices (e.g., hand-washing, sterilization of reusable medical equipment, and cleaning of surfaces) have to be even stricter for HCV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All the HIV/AIDS prevention efforts never managed to curtail one significant contributor to the spread of blood-borne infections in low- and middle-income countries: unnecessary injections. In Egypt, where there is a generalized HCV epidemic, the prevalence is highest in people with ongoing or a past history of medical injections. It will require determined education efforts to change the practice of re-using needles for vaccinations and other procedures.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, what is needed most fundamentally to prevent the spread of infectious diseases like hepatitis C is a well-functioning and well-staffed healthcare system – something that does not exist in many countries - along with political will, a willingness to invest in safer healthcare.</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YV2zVQC5-z0?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Many countries have only applied a few of the public health tools against HCV. Is that an option?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As most chronic patients are asymptomatic it might seem easy to ignore the disease, but there can be serious impacts on a community or a country’s health care resources. If a large group of individuals begins to exhibit liver disease within the same time frame, as expected in this case, then governments will indeed be faced with an acute problem. What course of action politicians decide to take determines the outcome of this public health issue.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of instituting sound health policies can slow their adoption. For example, when a blood test for HCV became available in the early 1990s, some countries were slow to incorporate it as part of the regular screening of blood in hospitals as they had already spent a considerable amount in the 1980s to set up screening for HIV/AIDS.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Even before HCV was identified in 1989 it was known that a non-A, non-B hepatitis was circulating in the blood supply. It is estimated that in the 1970s in the U.S., the risk of contracting hepatitis from blood-transfusion was as high as 30 per cent. Thanks to screening of donor blood, that risk dropped to almost zero by the year 2000.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WsB0L7KqU18?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Questions worth asking:</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Overuse of (unnecessary) injections with unsterile equipment seems to be a driver in spreading the virus, seen not only in Egypt, but in many low- and middle-income countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Can education counter the popular belief that injections works against most everything?</em></li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to make sure that the needle being used in a medical procedure was sterile?</em></li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to make sure that the needle being used for an injection in a market stall was sterile?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A key question that was asked in country after country with regard to tainted blood and HIV/AIDS could also be applied to HCV:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Did public health do enough and in time to curb the spread of non-A, non-B hepatitis? Or did they opt to do nothing to save money?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a name="sec4"></a>\r\n<h2> 4. <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">The unknowingly infected</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Screening Strategies: How to find those who are infected and do not know it?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>A large number of people infected with HCV are ‛silent carriers‛ - meaning they show no symptoms for years, even decades. How can they be identified? And should they be identified if the resources </em><em>treat them are lacking</em><em>? </em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Universal screening – testing everyone systematically for HCV – is one approach, at least in theory. But, in most countries that is not practical, nor fiscally responsible, given all the other health priorities. Besides, a screening test only confirms past exposure to the virus. That would need to be followed up with other more costly tests that 1) confirm the continued presence of the virus circulating in the blood, and in what amounts, and 2) determine the degree damage to the liver. It is a cascade of testing that can quickly become very costly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ideally, what researchers would like to see is a single, inexpensive blood or serology test that provides all the relevant information. But a test like that is currently only a dream.</p>\r\n<em>If you rule out universal screening, you then move to selective screening of high-risk groups. But who do you target first?</em>\r\n\r\nIn the U.S. and Canada, systematic screening of all Baby Boomers is recommended – specifically everyone born between 1945 and 1965 in the U.S. and 1945 to 1975 in Canada.\r\n\r\nThis demographic group is singled out because they are at significant risk of having been exposed to tainted blood through a transfusion, through the sharing of needles and unprotected sex. Because HCV infection often takes decades to have serious health impacts – like cirrhosis and liver cancer – this group is also most likely to suffer health impacts.\r\n\r\nInjection drug users and prisoners are also obvious targets for screening, as are blood donors who are rejected because they have one or more risk factors. But it cannot be forgotten that a significant proportion of HCV carriers – as many as one in four – have no obvious risk factors. Many countries are also adding hepatitis C to the current panel of screening tests done on pregnant women, in the hope they can prevent the virus from being passed on from mother-to-child.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7sKLcICED7Q?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It should be noted, however, that a number of countries, such as the Scandinavian nations, have made a decision to not screen for hepatitis C. Their reasoning is that the incidence of HCV - the number of new cases - has been close to zero for the past 20 years and that the rare cases found are usually imported, i.e. they would not be found by screening residents of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Testing is fraught with ethical questions.</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on present knowledge, roughly 70 per cent of those infected will probably not develop serious complications as a result of their infection. However, the test in itself cannot determine whether a patient will be among the 30 per cent who will develop a life-threatening liver disease. In addition, it is not known whether the 70/30 division will hold up over the long term. Only time will tell.</p>\r\nCurrent treatment protocols call for offering treatment first to patients showing the effects of chronic HCV infection, because it is believed they are most likely to develop cirrhosis or liver cancer. But how do you reassure the other 70 per cent, the people who know they are infected but have no obvious illness? Will they be satisfied with simply being monitored, knowing they too could fall ill down the road?\r\n\r\n<span style="color: #000000;">The key ethical question is whether you should actually test broadly if the resources do not exist to treat and care for everyone who has been identified as a carrier.</span>\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DmRaC6BsURc?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But it could also be argued that even if there is no promise of treatment, it would still be valuable to know whether you are infected. Because of the preventive steps you can take, like drinking less alcohol, and reducing the stress on the liver. Or being careful not to infect others (e.g., not sharing toothbrushes or razors with others, informing dentists and health care workers of infection status).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If treatment is unavailable, should people be informed that they are infected with a virus that could potentially cause cancer? Is it unethical to withhold that information?</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3QAP8fdq5X4?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Once identified, what next?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis C is a resource-intensive disease that many health systems will find hard to manage. A strong health system is required, and the ever-growing case load can potentially overwhelm even well-endowed systems.</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_s6bDMbzmQ?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\nOne way low- and middle income countries have dealt with the crush burden of HIV/AIDS, has been to establish a parallel health system, caring only for patient with that condition. Could that approach, called “vertical programs,” also work for hepatitis C? And does this offering of specialized care strengthen or weaken the overall health system? The experience that countries in West Africa lived with the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak is that this approach may be counter-productive, leaving the rest of the system weak and vulnerable to new challenges. Ideally, investing in programs to treat diseases like HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C should be done in a manner that bolsters the system overall.\r\n\r\nThe countries that do have a hepatitis policy usually have well-functioning health systems in place to build on, to integrate hepatitis into what already exists.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B1T4XcjX24c?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to note, however, that the expertise that has been built up in the HIV/AIDS programs could also be used to manage viral hepatitis, especially given the fact that the burden of HIV/AIDS is falling, and that of HCV is growing.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Do countries need a specific hepatitis policy?</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It depends, as often is the case, on the local settings.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If the health system has the capacity and the resources to treat and follow a patient with chronic hepatitis like they would treat and follow up any other patient, then probably not.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If the health system does not have that capacity, then a plan, based on know-how from WHO‛s Global Hepatitis Program may be a good idea, because it will tell what to do and in which order. Also it can be a tool for accountability, to make sure things are being done.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The accumulated case load is again the obstacle. Dealing with a crisis usually comes at a cost, financial and managerial, somewhere else in the system. Most, maybe all, health systems don’t run with funds and personnel to spare. Budgets and resources are limited, even in the strongest, most developed and well-resourced health systems. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa, so overwhelmed Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, that even with foreign assistance, other serious health problems could not be addressed; maternal health, malaria, vaccinations, as well as many emergency rooms were severely affected. Even high income countries may run into problems caused by a surge in need for a particular treatment or test. After beginning to offer screening for colorectal cancers to all persons between the ages of 50-74 years, the healthcare system in Denmark witnessed an unexpected increase in waiting lists―so many more patients than anticipated needed follow-up colonoscopies that a number of hospital units could not keep up, despite having had years to prepare for the roll out of the screening program.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Other questions to ask:</em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Doctors decide, based on guidelines, which patients receive treatment first.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>How are patients told they are not yet eligible for treatment?

But they offer great promise – the real possibility of cure for many HCV carriers, and preventing a countless number of future infections.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">How drugs are priced, the profits they generate and the benefits they confer are the subject of much debate, and nowhere more so than when it comes to hepatitis C, because of the tremendous numbers of people infected.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some believe the price the pharmaceutical companies are asking for new drugs like Harvoni are based on what they can extract from governments and insurance companies rather than actual costs plus a reasonable return. Companies argue that the cost of research and development are astronomical and the drugs, while highly-priced, are a good investment because of the benefits to sufferers and the future HCV cases that will be prevented.</p>\r\nIn reality, we often don’t know the actual price paid, because list prices vary by country, and insurance plans, private and public, negotiate discounts.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CyomWClUeGk?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\nWith HIV/AIDS drugs, these tiered pricing schemes, and agreements signed with generic companies have brought prices down markedly and made treatment available to millions.\r\n\r\nWill the same thing happen with hepatitis C drugs?\r\n\r\nWe don’t know.\r\n\r\nWhat is known is that strong advocacy and the involvement of high-profile global health groups like The Global Fund, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Clinton Foundation created tremendous pressure to find solutions. Hepatitis C does not have that profile and the backing of people with star power – at least not yet.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wZVs9zImIBQ?feature=oembed&amp;start=2" width="604" height="340" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Who to treat and follow up?</em>\r\n\r\nCurrent European and American guidelines do not recommend treating all those who test positive as soon as they are found. Most infected are asymptomatic for years and considered in no urgent need of treatment. Giving the medication too early may cause more harm than benefit.\r\n\r\nBased on the progression of disease, the physician will decide when to start the treatment. However, there is no universal agreement on when that time is.\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ptks9wMhJXY?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment rids the body of the hepatitis C virus, but it does not eliminate or reverse liver disease. So the word “cure” is a bit misleading. Still, if the progression of disease can be halted, there should be less liver disease in the future, and that holds out the promise of drastically reducing the need for liver transplants, a very costly procedure. But reaping those savings in some distant future comes with a heavy price in the here and now. Today, health care systems are hit twice - they have to pay for the treatment as well as for liver transplants for those who have had chronic infection. To those already in need of a new liver the cure has come too late.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> <em>Will lowering the price of the drugs solve all problems? </em></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Not necessarily. Of course it will make the drugs more accessible, but some of the bottlenecks in the system will remain, even if the drugs were available for free.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the first hurdles to overcome is having the drug registered within every country in which it is going to be used. The pharmaceutical company holding the rights to a product may not want to register it, because it will be too costly compared to what they can expect to earn. A generic manufacturer may also have concerns, because a generic drug has to be prequalified by the WHO, which is also costly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment involves testing, and tests have a price as well, not to mention that laboratories and trained personnel are required. Even in the industrialized countries trained personnel are in short supply. There are few physicians who specialize in liver disease, and taking on an extra caseload will be a challenge for them. Health systems do not have the excess capacity.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> <em>Questions worth asking:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Is there a limit to how many new, high priced drugs governments and insurance companies are willing to pay for?</em></li>\r\n	<li><em>Will price be an (overruling) indicator for which patients will be given access to expensive drugs?</em></li>\r\n	<li>Usually pharmaceutical companies use the argument of cost of research, clinical trials, approval, and drug candidates that turned out to be blind end, to justify prices. <em>But once those costs have been recuperated, will prices come down?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<em>Developing stories to keep in mind:</em>\r\n\r\nAt the Millennium Summit at the United Nations in September 2000, world leaders committed to help achieve the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. The MDGs are to be replaced by Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that from 2016 and onwards will set targets for future international development.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Will HCV be a specific SDG?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is a public-private partnership that began operating in 2002 as an international financing organization that aims to »attract and disburse additional resources to prevent and treat HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria«.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Recently The Fund simplified its logo to just: The Global Fund.<em> Is The Global Fund about to embrace HCV?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;', 'Public policy', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '22-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-11-06 20:00:47', '2015-11-06 20:00:47', '', 22, 'http://localhost/projects/clients/WFSJ/web/?p=201', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

It was a manufactured version of interferons, proteins naturally produced in the body that enhance the immune system’s response to viral infection. <strong>Interferon-alfa (IFN-α)</strong> treatment required subcutaneous injections three to five times per week.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2001, two modified forms of interferon were introduced (PEGylated interferons: PegIFN-α2a and PegIFN-α2b). These modified interferons circulated in the body for a longer period of time before being cleared by the kidneys, so injections were only needed once a week.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A drug combination that included <strong>PEGylated interferon-α</strong> later became the standard of care for hepatitis C. <strong>Ribavirin</strong> was administered with <strong>PEGylated interferon-α</strong> to enhance its effects, but despite this improvement, still less than half of patients benefitted from treatment. Genotype 1, the most common strain of Hepatitis C in higher income countries, was particularly unresponsive to these drugs. The treatment regimen required ingestion of several capsules of ribavirin per day and one injection per week of PEGylated interferon for 48 weeks. Many people abandoned therapy prematurely because of intolerable side effects such as flu-like symptoms, including fever and weakness. Anemia was also common and often severe. Some patients reported that their treatment had a significant impact on mood, leading to feelings of depression (See<strong> Figure 1</strong>).</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">These treatments improved the patient’s natural response against HCV, but did not target the virus itself. Efficacy was low, while side effects were significant.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A cure against HCV genotype 1, the most common strain of HCV in high income countries, remained elusive. Drug companies saw a large and potentially profitable market so they steered funds and resources towards this branch of research. Publicly funded research was also aggressively investigating viral hepatitis C during this period.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">These efforts led to the development of a new class of drugs – the direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). This class of drug does not affect the patient’s immune system, but attacks the virus itself, blocking one or more steps of its life-cycle. The precise mechanism of the different DAAs will be explored in s<strong>ection 2</strong>.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2011, the protease inhibitors were the first DAAs to be introduced, named for their ability to inhibit viral protein synthesis. <strong>Boceprevir</strong> and <strong>telaprevir</strong>, both given orally in combination with PEGylated interferon-α and ribavirin, improved cure rates (the percentage of people cured)― up to 75% for genotype 1, but they also produced additional side effects to those already present with previous treatments and increased the overall burden of side effects proportionately (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Another research breakthrough led to the development of new HCV DAAs that could inhibit viral replication. Their first passage from clinical trials to the real world was a disappointment, however; despite good results in initial trials, these treatments proved to be less effective and more toxic (even fatal) when used in the field.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The turning point was in 2014. A new class of direct acting antivirals (DAA) was released on the market. <strong>Sofosbuvir</strong> was very effective on genotype 1 and produced successful results in a great majority of patients. Administered in combination with PEGylated interferon and ribavirin, Sofosbuvir tablets produced a cure rate of over 90 % of patients with hepatitis C genotype 1, 2, 3 and 4. In addition, the new treatment was much shorter (usually 12-24 weeks), simple to take, and very well tolerated.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In the months that followed, other DAA drugs and DAA drug <strong>combinations</strong> with comparable dramatic success rates were approved (see table 1). Indeed, it had become clear that by combining more than one drug, each acting on a different aspect of the virus life cycle, the highly mutable Hepatitis C virus could be stopped, and its resistance to treatment prevented (see <strong>section 2</strong> for a discussion on <em>how drug combinations successfully provide a high barrier to resistance</em>).</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Another advancement between late 2014 and early 2015, was the discovery that interferon-free regimens (sometimes even without ribavirin) can be equally effective, showing that it may be possible to circumvent the worst treatment side effects that continued to hinder treatment and compliance in some patients.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Figure-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2460 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Figure-1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" height="487" width="828"></a></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAware-BOX-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2462 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAware-BOX-1.jpg" alt="BeAware BOX 1" height="1047" width="1992"></a>The development of the new DAA drugs caused a major shift in the hepatitis C treatment landscape –they could be used to treat every patient with the disease. However getting access to them would prove difficult. Their prohibitive price has meant that they are beyond the reach of a majority of patients, especially in low and middle income countries.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All over the world, patient associations, doctors and health authorities are advocating for industries to drop these prices in order to treat as many patients as possible, as was done for HIV/AIDS drugs.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This has shifted the focus of the hepatitis C problem from a medical issue to one of public policy. Political, economic, and ethical issues surrounding access to care and who pays the costs of medical research, drug development and marketing, are at the forefront of this rapidly evolving health issue.</p>\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/50w8LdjdYIo?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe><br>\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-11.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2461 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-11.jpg" alt="Table 1" height="2988" width="2039"></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cjszp5h6Q04?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul style="font-size: 15px; color: black;">\n<li style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;According to their mechanism of action, the new DAAs drugs can be classified into 4 classes:<br>\n1. the first class, <strong>NS3-4A protease inhibitors</strong>, block the production of <strong>viral proteins</strong> (i.e. simeprevir, paritaprevir)</li>\n<li style="text-align: justify;">All the other three classes block the production of <strong>viral genes</strong> (RNA).<br>\nThese include:<br>\n2. <strong>Nucleotide analogues</strong> that inhibit the enzyme (NS5B polymerase) needed for viral replication (i.e. sofosbuvir);<br>\n3.<strong> Non-nucleotide analogues</strong> that inhibit the same enzyme (NS5B polymerase) needed for viral replication but with a different mechanism (i.e. dasabuvir);<br>\n4. <strong>NS5A inhibitors</strong> block both the replication and the assembly of the virus (i.e. ledipasvir, daclatasvir, ombitasvir,..)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As of July 2015, the approved treatments available for treating Hep C are summarized in the following table:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2b_revised_smaller.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2725 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2b_revised_smaller.jpg" alt="Table 2b_revised_smaller" height="1061" width="1198"></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAwareBOX-2.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2469 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAwareBOX-2.jpg" alt="BeAwareBOX 2" height="336" width="1192"></a></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Many other new molecules and combinations are currently under investigation in order to simplify the treatment and tackle the few patients resistant to the current available drugs.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a name="sec2"></a></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">2) <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">How is the efficacy of anti HCV drugs measured? Is the currently used outcome reliable?</span></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The best way to assess the efficacy of anti HCV drugs as well as of any other treatment would be through well designed randomized, placebo controlled trials - possibly independent from industry - that would measure the effect of drugs on the progression of liver disease and on the risk of illness/morbidity and mortality. These would prove that the new drugs not only cure infection, but can prevent more advanced liver disease and deaths that happen decades later in people with chronic infection.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However disease progression of chronic hepatitis C is very slow. Conditions like cirrhosis and liver cancer take decades to develop and these clinical outcomes must be measured 20-30 years after the <strong>time</strong> of treatment. These types of trials would be very costly. Furthermore, a relatively small proportion of patients develop a severe disease (15-30% of patients with chronic hepatitis develop <strong>cirrhosis</strong> and 3-17% of patients with cirrhosis develop<strong> liver cancer</strong>), so <strong>large numbers</strong> of participants would need to be included in these trials to reach statistical significance. There are also ethical considerations, regarding the use of a placebo control group in this case!</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A surrogate outcome is therefore used in these situations. This is a measure that does not directly assess the important outcome (ie.: reducing severe liver disease and death), but is believed to reflect the important outcome. The measure used here is the continued absence of hepatitis C virus in blood for 6 months which is referred to as a sustained virologic response (SVR)).</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The reliability of this outcome has been questioned by some experts because it is not clear whether the virus might “hide” in certain cellular compartments and body tissues while the bloodstream is clear of virus. Several studies conducted in the past with older therapies showed however that a sustained response usually corresponds to 1) a lack of virus in other body tissues -indeed, the idea that the virus could hide in so called “sanctuaries”, i.e. other tissues, as HIV does, has never been proven and 2) less liver related illness/morbidity and mortality compared with people without a sustained response</p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a name="sec3"></a></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">3) <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">How effective are the new HCV drugs in clinical trials and in the real world?</span></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Indeed, recent clinical trials on the new drugs for HCV, the DAAs, are reporting 85-100% cure rates across genotypes, with the precise level of effectiveness depending on the genotype and drug combination. However, it is important to note that these drugs are still under investigation, and we do not yet have much data on what the results will be in the field– Real life is always messier in terms of treatment safety and efficacy. Below are the issues that must be considered when interpreting clinical trial results.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAwareBOX-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2486" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAwareBOX-3-1024x672.jpg" alt="BeAwareBOX 3" height="590" width="900"></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;The 5-15% matter:</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, even a small percentage, such as the 5-15% of patients that will not respond to treatment or experience a relapse, can represent a very large absolute number of patients that could fail treatment when it comes to treating millions of people all over the world.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If we anticipate that 10 per cent of patients will not experience success with the new drugs, then 15 million people in the world will not be cured with treatment. So we can say that the great majority of patients today in theory could be cured, but not all of them. Issues with resistance will also arise in this patient population, because treatment failure will represent selection of drug-resistant viruses, and alternate second-line treatment choices will be limited.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-3_revisedFINAL_smaller.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2745 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-3_revisedFINAL_smaller.jpg" alt="Table 3_revisedFINAL_smaller" height="965" width="604"></a></p>\n<p align="center">&nbsp;<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ywQQ9zfpbDY?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a name="sec4"></a></p>\n<p>4) <strong><a name="sec4"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What drives the choice of treatment?</span></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The choice of treatment for chronic hepatitis C is driven by many factors linked to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style="text-align: justify;">the<strong> virus genotype</strong> (and sometimes subtype)</li>\n<li style="text-align: justify;">the <strong>stage of liver disease</strong> (especially the presence of cirrhosis)</li>\n<li style="text-align: justify;">patient’s <strong>clinical history</strong> (such as being treated before/having undergone a treatment failure)</li>\n<li style="text-align: justify;">The patient’s <strong>genetic characteristics</strong> (for example which ethnic group they are part of) can have an impact on the efficacy of older drugs. A variant of gene <strong>IL28B</strong> – a gene involved in the immune response to HCV. There are three IL28B subtypes – CC, CT, TT. If a person has the CC variant of the gene, the individual is not only more likely to clear the virus without treatment during the acute phase, if a chronic infection does develop it is 3 times likely that PegIFN and Ribavirin will cure infection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, the presence of a<strong> Q80K</strong> genetic variant that develops in certain strains of HCV makes the virus less susceptible to simeprevir.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Possible co-infections</strong> (i.e. with Hepatitis BVirus and/or HIV) do not influence therapeutic approaches with the new drugs, but still need to be considered in all those settings where the latest treatments are not available.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, the most relevant, often critical, factor in the choice of treatment in most parts of the world is currently the <strong>access to the new drugs.</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This issue will be dealt with in a following section.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL 2015), as well as the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) rely on <strong>clinical aspects</strong> to formulate treatment recommendations. These recommendations identify the best approved treatment options (either in Europe or in the USA) for each patient based on current scientific evidence.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">On this basis, without considering economic issues, the EASL 2015 guidelines recommend interferon-free regimens as the best option, when available, in all HCV infected patients because of their effectiveness, ease of use, and tolerability.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Where new drugs are not available, either PegIFNα+ ribavirin or triple combination with telaprevir or boceprevir (protease inhibitors) remain acceptable in selected patients likely to respond, at least until new drugs become available and affordable.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The choice of treatment is mainly based on HCV genotype, HCV subtype and viral load. Also to be considered is whether the patient has cirrhosis, or has been treated previously with other drugs.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Different options, unless otherwise indicated, are equally effective, so that doctors can choose what is best and economically feasible for each patient, according to the reimbursement conditions in their own country.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dEtaTAzfWKg?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>THE CHOICE OF TREATMENT ACCORDING TO EASL 2015</p>\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-4B-copy.gif"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2492 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-4B-copy.gif" alt="Table 4B copy" height="5368" width="2790"></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<p><a name="sec5"></a></p>\n<p><strong>5) <span style="color: #3366ff;">Could widespread use of the new drugs lead to emergence of resistant strains?</span></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the hepatitis C virus can change or mutate, some strains naturally acquire genetic characteristics that make them resistant to one treatment or another. When an antiviral drug is given, it blocks replication in all sensitive viruses. Those viruses that are resistant are able to proliferate in that patient. The patient does not respond to treatment anymore and the disease grows. To avoid this, a combination of drugs that affect different aspects of HCV viral replication have always been given together, for a duration that is sufficient to eliminate the infection.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite this, some patients still become resistant to treatment and other options have to be found. The best strategy for these cases is still under investigation.</p>\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c_vxvCY1_qc?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">6<a name="sec6"></a><strong>)<span style="color: #3366ff;"> Do new drugs have side effects?</span></strong><br>\nThe new drugs against hepatitis C, the so-called “second-generation DAAs”, are very well tolerated by patients and cause <strong>fewer, and much less severe, side effects</strong> than the previous treatments. Patients who were previously treated with earlier generations of medications report a significant difference.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, it cannot be said that this issue has been completely overcome. Many regimens still require<strong> interferons and/or ribavirin</strong> because of the characteristics of the virus and the stage of liver disease. The side effects of these drugs (anemia, low white cell count, headache, fatigue, skin rashes and so on) must be considered by all the patients for whom interferon and ribavirin-free treatment <strong>cannot be prescribed</strong>.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The risk of adverse events may always be considered an acceptable alternative to liver failure or cancer in patients with advanced liver disease. However for those without concurrent liver disease the risks associated with treatment may be less acceptable, as only a fraction of them will go on to develop serious consequences.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, safety data on new treatments are still limited, since <strong>post-marketing surveillance</strong> (i.e. the recording of any registered side effect when a drug is on the shelves) for most of these drugs has just begun. Post-marketing surveillance is always important, but even more so for new drugs such as these, which were approved very rapidly because of their ability to cure infection and save lives.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In the clinical trials, the rate of serious adverse events (resulting in persistent disability, hospital admission, or death) was very low (0,5-3%) . Such a<strong> small percentage</strong>, could still represent a significant<strong> absolute number</strong> of cases if millions of people are treated. Of the estimated 150 million people in world who are infected chronic HCV, this percentage of adverse events would represent 750, 000 to 4.5 million people affected.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treating hundreds of thousands people could also reveal <strong>rare side effects</strong> unlikely to be detected in trials with fewer participants.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the safety profile of these drugs needs to be evaluated in <strong>unselected patients</strong>, who can have other concurrent diseases, genetic characteristics, be of different ages and ethnic groups.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The main cause for concern at the moment is the risk of <strong>drug interactions</strong>. This kind of side effect can more easily emerge when treatment is given in the real world, where patients can have other diseases for which they take medications not considered during clinical trials.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">An example of this is the recent FDA advisory about <strong>amiodarone</strong>, a drug used to treat the irregular beating of the heart (arrhythmias). When taken with simeprevir and other antivirals, severe (even fatal) bradycardia has been reported prompting the US FDA to published an alert against the concomitant use of these two medications.</p>\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uUuTnWO0PWU?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a name="sec7"></a></p>\n<p><strong>7) <span style="color: #3366ff;">Does co-infection with HIV change the management of hepatitis C?</span></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a significant amount of stigma associated with HIV and HCV. Both are infectious diseases which in and of itself is sufficient to lead to stigma and discrimination, especially if the diseases and their methods of transmission are not well understood by the general public. Further, in certain countries the incidence of these viruses is highest among intravenous drug users.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Co-infection with HIV does not have an impact on the success rate of the new direct antivirals. However co-infected patients still require more attention because they have a higher risk of drug-drug interactions and their impaired immune systems could let the disease progress more quickly and aggressively.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p>8<a name="sec8"></a><strong>) <span style="color: #3366ff;">Who determines dosage?</span></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Optimal dosage and length of anti HCV treatments have been established in clinical trials. The recommended dosage is a set parameter, not to be changed. However, the degree of “aggressiveness” of a drug therapy can be changed by altering: 1) the number of drugs in the combination and 2) the length of treatment. “Overtreatment” may be advisable in real life settings for patients who are more difficult to cure. However, under-treatment without supporting evidence could lead to the emergence of dangerous resistant strains.</p>\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gNugNchJGUg?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong><a name="sec9"></a>9) <span style="color: #3366ff;">Who should be tested?</span></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the vast majority of people are unaware of their condition because they are asymptomatic or experiencing symptoms too generic to arouse suspicion, patients must first be identified before addressing treatment issues. This can be done by <strong>screening</strong>.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There are controversial <strong>policy issues</strong> surrounding the ethics of screening, particularly if a country does not have the resources to treat the number of individuals that are expected to be identified. This is discussed at length in the<em> public policy module</em>.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some countries recommend screening people with risk factors such as current or previous injection drug users or those who received blood transfusions prior to implementing safe screening strategies. Other countries recommend screening high risk groups, such as those born between 1945-1965 ― a generation that was more exposed to infection before the virus was identified.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As the risk of being infected is higher in these groups, the probability of finding patients with asymptomatic liver disease who would benefit from treatment is higher as well.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Encouraging everybody to get tested, would increase the number of infected people identified. Many of these individuals may have been well for decades (and maybe would have died of other causes before even knowing they were infected by HCV), but they are now suddenly told that they have a disease. Since transmission of HCV is not so easy in everyday life, and common hygienic habits are enough to avoid it, this revelation is unlikely to improve prevention measures markedly. However studies show that people diagnosed with HCV express relief in knowing about their disease as they feel more in control of avoiding infecting those they love. In addition, individuals who become aware of their infection can take measures to help limit further damage to their liver. There are many life style changes that an infected patient can adopt, such as no longer consuming alcohol.</p>\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h4KyRlpLhSk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\n<p>Add Charles gore video 13 in the policy section--------------------------------------</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a name="sec10"></a>10)<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"> Who should be treated?</span></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that effective and tolerable treatments are available, many patients’ associations, doctors and experts worldwide feel that <strong>all the people infected with HCV</strong> should be treated, irrespective of the state of their liver or of the cost of treatment.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">From a clinical point of view, the goal of treatment is to cure HCV patients of infection to prevent hepatic cirrhosis, or halt cirrhosis before the liver is too damaged to function, known as decompensated cirrhosis. Other long terms effects include liver cancer, and even severe health issues in other parts of the body – including autoimmune conditions and nephropathies, and death.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, the cure reduces the risk of decompensation and cancer. When a patient already has decompensated cirrhosis, the treatment can reduce the need for a liver transplantation. However, it should be noted that the impact on middle-to long term survival in these patients is still unknown.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the 2015 EASL guidelines, <strong>all patients with chronic liver disease</strong> due to HCV should be considered for treatment, with priorities associated to the severity of their condition.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment with an interferon-free regimen is urgent in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and should be prioritized in patients with significant fibrosis or cirrhosis, i.e. with F3 to F4 score on the METAVIR scale of liver disease severity.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In patients with no damage or mild disease the treatment can be either deferred or considered in particular cases of severity (HBV or HIV coinfection, significant extra-hepatic manifestations, debilitating fatigue) or when the risk of transmitting HCV to others is high.</p>\n<p><strong>Indications for treatment of chronic hepatitis C in 2015: Who should be treated and when?</strong></p>\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-5.gif"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2493 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-5.gif" alt="Table 5" height="1939" width="4077"></a></p>\n<p>Modified from EASL Recommendations on Treatment of Hepatitis C 2015</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qnSKUC7IPU4?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\n<hr>\n<p><a name="sec10"></a></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">10) <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Is eradication of hepatitis C the actual goal?</span></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the availability of very effective treatments, complete<strong> eradication</strong> of hepatitis C from the world is not a realistic goal without a vaccine. A much more realistic goal is <strong>control</strong> of the disease, which can be achieved at least in high income countries, through prevention, diagnosis, a good healthcare system and access to drugs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l4hdxRzmvDs?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a name="sec11"></a>11.<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"> How much do these new drugs cost?</span></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Negotiations between countries and pharmaceutical companies vary from one country to another. As a result, their price is different from drug to drug and from country to country.<br>\nIn the US, when sofosbuvir was introduced, each pill cost about 1000 dollars US, for a total price of 80.000-90.000 dollars for a cycle of 12 weeks.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In Europe different health systems have negotiated different prices, in some circumstances up to half the US price. In Italy, for example, a price/volume system of payment has been established, with the cost of drugs going down the more patients are treated.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In low income countries firms have agreed on a cheaper price. In Egypt a whole cycle of sofosbuvir costs about 500 US dollars. In India, Gilead (the company that owns sofosbuvir) has allowed 11 generic firms to produce the drug at low prices and sell it to about 90 developing countries, with a list of clauses to avoid illicit marketing towards middle and high-income countries.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zge-TvYFc9g?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>12)<a name="sec12"></a> <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">How is (and could) Hepatitis C be treated and managed in low and middle resources countries?</span></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The challenge of Hepatitis C in low and middle income countries is not only about the price of drugs. There are other hurdles to face, such as traditional habits that hinder prevention and facilitate the transmission of the disease, the cost and difficulties of screening and the lack of medical resources. Hepatologists, for example, are very rare in Africa, but infectious disease specialists knowledgeable in liver diseases could be recruited. The network of institutions, facilities and staff built up to address HIV in many low and middle income countries could be now exploited to deal with HCV as well.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When an effective treatment to control AIDS was developed, it seemed costs would be prohibitive for low income countries. Instead, today, thanks to the efforts of governments, industry and non- governmental organizations, most patients who are diagnosed in the world can have access to treatment.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The same result can hopefully be achieved for hepatitis C.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bSaLvzqsRmU?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">REFERENCES</span></strong></p>\n<p>Ghany MG, Strader DB, Thomas DL, Seeff LB; American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.

It was a manufactured version of interferons, proteins naturally produced in the body that enhance the immune system’s response to viral infection. <strong>Interferon-alfa (IFN-α)</strong> treatment required subcutaneous injections three to five times per week.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2001, two modified forms of interferon were introduced (PEGylated interferons: PegIFN-α2a and PegIFN-α2b). These modified interferons circulated in the body for a longer period of time before being cleared by the kidneys, so injections were only needed once a week.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A drug combination that included <strong>PEGylated interferon-α</strong> later became the standard of care for hepatitis C. <strong>Ribavirin</strong> was administered with <strong>PEGylated interferon-α</strong> to enhance its effects, but despite this improvement, still less than half of patients benefitted from treatment. Genotype 1, the most common strain of Hepatitis C in higher income countries, was particularly unresponsive to these drugs. The treatment regimen required ingestion of several capsules of ribavirin per day and one injection per week of PEGylated interferon for 48 weeks. Many people abandoned therapy prematurely because of intolerable side effects such as flu-like symptoms, including fever and weakness. Anemia was also common and often severe. Some patients reported that their treatment had a significant impact on mood, leading to feelings of depression (See<strong> Figure 1</strong>).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">These treatments improved the patient’s natural response against HCV, but did not target the virus itself. Efficacy was low, while side effects were significant.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A cure against HCV genotype 1, the most common strain of HCV in high income countries, remained elusive. Drug companies saw a large and potentially profitable market so they steered funds and resources towards this branch of research. Publicly funded research was also aggressively investigating viral hepatitis C during this period.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">These efforts led to the development of a new class of drugs – the direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). This class of drug does not affect the patient’s immune system, but attacks the virus itself, blocking one or more steps of its life-cycle. The precise mechanism of the different DAAs will be explored in s<strong>ection 2</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2011, the protease inhibitors were the first DAAs to be introduced, named for their ability to inhibit viral protein synthesis. <strong>Boceprevir</strong> and <strong>telaprevir</strong>, both given orally in combination with PEGylated interferon-α and ribavirin, improved cure rates (the percentage of people cured)― up to 75% for genotype 1, but they also produced additional side effects to those already present with previous treatments and increased the overall burden of side effects proportionately (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Another research breakthrough led to the development of new HCV DAAs that could inhibit viral replication. Their first passage from clinical trials to the real world was a disappointment, however; despite good results in initial trials, these treatments proved to be less effective and more toxic (even fatal) when used in the field.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The turning point was in 2014. A new class of direct acting antivirals (DAA) was released on the market. <strong>Sofosbuvir</strong> was very effective on genotype 1 and produced successful results in a great majority of patients. Administered in combination with PEGylated interferon and ribavirin, Sofosbuvir tablets produced a cure rate of over 90 % of patients with hepatitis C genotype 1, 2, 3 and 4. In addition, the new treatment was much shorter (usually 12-24 weeks), simple to take, and very well tolerated.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In the months that followed, other DAA drugs and DAA drug <strong>combinations</strong> with comparable dramatic success rates were approved (see table 1). Indeed, it had become clear that by combining more than one drug, each acting on a different aspect of the virus life cycle, the highly mutable Hepatitis C virus could be stopped, and its resistance to treatment prevented (see <strong>section 2</strong> for a discussion on <em>how drug combinations successfully provide a high barrier to resistance</em>).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Another advancement between late 2014 and early 2015, was the discovery that interferon-free regimens (sometimes even without ribavirin) can be equally effective, showing that it may be possible to circumvent the worst treatment side effects that continued to hinder treatment and compliance in some patients.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Figure-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2460 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Figure-1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" height="487" width="828"></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAware-BOX-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2462 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAware-BOX-1.jpg" alt="BeAware BOX 1" height="1047" width="1992"></a>The development of the new DAA drugs caused a major shift in the hepatitis C treatment landscape –they could be used to treat every patient with the disease. However getting access to them would prove difficult. Their prohibitive price has meant that they are beyond the reach of a majority of patients, especially in low and middle income countries.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All over the world, patient associations, doctors and health authorities are advocating for industries to drop these prices in order to treat as many patients as possible, as was done for HIV/AIDS drugs.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This has shifted the focus of the hepatitis C problem from a medical issue to one of public policy. Political, economic, and ethical issues surrounding access to care and who pays the costs of medical research, drug development and marketing, are at the forefront of this rapidly evolving health issue.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/50w8LdjdYIo?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe><br>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-11.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2461 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-11.jpg" alt="Table 1" height="2988" width="2039"></a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cjszp5h6Q04?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul style="font-size: 15px; color: black;">\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;According to their mechanism of action, the new DAAs drugs can be classified into 4 classes:<br>\r\n1. the first class, <strong>NS3-4A protease inhibitors</strong>, block the production of <strong>viral proteins</strong> (i.e. simeprevir, paritaprevir)</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">All the other three classes block the production of <strong>viral genes</strong> (RNA).<br>\r\nThese include:<br>\r\n2. <strong>Nucleotide analogues</strong> that inhibit the enzyme (NS5B polymerase) needed for viral replication (i.e. sofosbuvir);<br>\r\n3.<strong> Non-nucleotide analogues</strong> that inhibit the same enzyme (NS5B polymerase) needed for viral replication but with a different mechanism (i.e. dasabuvir);<br>\r\n4. <strong>NS5A inhibitors</strong> block both the replication and the assembly of the virus (i.e. ledipasvir, daclatasvir, ombitasvir,..)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As of July 2015, the approved treatments available for treating Hep C are summarized in the following table:</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2b_revised_smaller.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2725 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2b_revised_smaller.jpg" alt="Table 2b_revised_smaller" height="1061" width="1198"></a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAwareBOX-2.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2469 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAwareBOX-2.jpg" alt="BeAwareBOX 2" height="336" width="1192"></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Many other new molecules and combinations are currently under investigation in order to simplify the treatment and tackle the few patients resistant to the current available drugs.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><a name="sec2"></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">2) <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">How is the efficacy of anti HCV drugs measured? Is the currently used outcome reliable?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The best way to assess the efficacy of anti HCV drugs as well as of any other treatment would be through well designed randomized, placebo controlled trials - possibly independent from industry - that would measure the effect of drugs on the progression of liver disease and on the risk of illness/morbidity and mortality. These would prove that the new drugs not only cure infection, but can prevent more advanced liver disease and deaths that happen decades later in people with chronic infection.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However disease progression of chronic hepatitis C is very slow. Conditions like cirrhosis and liver cancer take decades to develop and these clinical outcomes must be measured 20-30 years after the <strong>time</strong> of treatment. These types of trials would be very costly. Furthermore, a relatively small proportion of patients develop a severe disease (15-30% of patients with chronic hepatitis develop <strong>cirrhosis</strong> and 3-17% of patients with cirrhosis develop<strong> liver cancer</strong>), so <strong>large numbers</strong> of participants would need to be included in these trials to reach statistical significance. There are also ethical considerations, regarding the use of a placebo control group in this case!</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A surrogate outcome is therefore used in these situations. This is a measure that does not directly assess the important outcome (ie.: reducing severe liver disease and death), but is believed to reflect the important outcome. The measure used here is the continued absence of hepatitis C virus in blood for 6 months which is referred to as a sustained virologic response (SVR)).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The reliability of this outcome has been questioned by some experts because it is not clear whether the virus might “hide” in certain cellular compartments and body tissues while the bloodstream is clear of virus. Several studies conducted in the past with older therapies showed however that a sustained response usually corresponds to 1) a lack of virus in other body tissues -indeed, the idea that the virus could hide in so called “sanctuaries”, i.e. other tissues, as HIV does, has never been proven and 2) less liver related illness/morbidity and mortality compared with people without a sustained response</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a name="sec3"></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">3) <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">How effective are the new HCV drugs in clinical trials and in the real world?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Indeed, recent clinical trials on the new drugs for HCV, the DAAs, are reporting 85-100% cure rates across genotypes, with the precise level of effectiveness depending on the genotype and drug combination. However, it is important to note that these drugs are still under investigation, and we do not yet have much data on what the results will be in the field– Real life is always messier in terms of treatment safety and efficacy. Below are the issues that must be considered when interpreting clinical trial results.</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAwareBOX-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2486" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeAwareBOX-3-1024x672.jpg" alt="BeAwareBOX 3" height="590" width="900"></a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;The 5-15% matter:</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, even a small percentage, such as the 5-15% of patients that will not respond to treatment or experience a relapse, can represent a very large absolute number of patients that could fail treatment when it comes to treating millions of people all over the world.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If we anticipate that 10 per cent of patients will not experience success with the new drugs, then 15 million people in the world will not be cured with treatment. So we can say that the great majority of patients today in theory could be cured, but not all of them. Issues with resistance will also arise in this patient population, because treatment failure will represent selection of drug-resistant viruses, and alternate second-line treatment choices will be limited.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-3_revisedFINAL_smaller.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2745 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-3_revisedFINAL_smaller.jpg" alt="Table 3_revisedFINAL_smaller" height="965" width="604"></a></p>\r\n<p align="center">&nbsp;<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ywQQ9zfpbDY?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a name="sec4"></a></p>\r\n<p>4) <strong><a name="sec4"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What drives the choice of treatment?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The choice of treatment for chronic hepatitis C is driven by many factors linked to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">the<strong> virus genotype</strong> (and sometimes subtype)</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">the <strong>stage of liver disease</strong> (especially the presence of cirrhosis)</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">patient’s <strong>clinical history</strong> (such as being treated before/having undergone a treatment failure)</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">The patient’s <strong>genetic characteristics</strong> (for example which ethnic group they are part of) can have an impact on the efficacy of older drugs. A variant of gene <strong>IL28B</strong> – a gene involved in the immune response to HCV. There are three IL28B subtypes – CC, CT, TT. If a person has the CC variant of the gene, the individual is not only more likely to clear the virus without treatment during the acute phase, if a chronic infection does develop it is 3 times likely that PegIFN and Ribavirin will cure infection.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, the presence of a<strong> Q80K</strong> genetic variant that develops in certain strains of HCV makes the virus less susceptible to simeprevir.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Possible co-infections</strong> (i.e. with Hepatitis BVirus and/or HIV) do not influence therapeutic approaches with the new drugs, but still need to be considered in all those settings where the latest treatments are not available.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, the most relevant, often critical, factor in the choice of treatment in most parts of the world is currently the <strong>access to the new drugs.</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This issue will be dealt with in a following section.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL 2015), as well as the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) rely on <strong>clinical aspects</strong> to formulate treatment recommendations. These recommendations identify the best approved treatment options (either in Europe or in the USA) for each patient based on current scientific evidence.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">On this basis, without considering economic issues, the EASL 2015 guidelines recommend interferon-free regimens as the best option, when available, in all HCV infected patients because of their effectiveness, ease of use, and tolerability.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Where new drugs are not available, either PegIFNα+ ribavirin or triple combination with telaprevir or boceprevir (protease inhibitors) remain acceptable in selected patients likely to respond, at least until new drugs become available and affordable.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The choice of treatment is mainly based on HCV genotype, HCV subtype and viral load. Also to be considered is whether the patient has cirrhosis, or has been treated previously with other drugs.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Different options, unless otherwise indicated, are equally effective, so that doctors can choose what is best and economically feasible for each patient, according to the reimbursement conditions in their own country.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dEtaTAzfWKg?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>THE CHOICE OF TREATMENT ACCORDING TO EASL 2015</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-4B-copy.gif"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2492 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-4B-copy.gif" alt="Table 4B copy" height="5368" width="2790"></a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><a name="sec5"></a></p>\r\n<p><strong>5) <span style="color: #3366ff;">Could widespread use of the new drugs lead to emergence of resistant strains?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the hepatitis C virus can change or mutate, some strains naturally acquire genetic characteristics that make them resistant to one treatment or another. When an antiviral drug is given, it blocks replication in all sensitive viruses. Those viruses that are resistant are able to proliferate in that patient. The patient does not respond to treatment anymore and the disease grows. To avoid this, a combination of drugs that affect different aspects of HCV viral replication have always been given together, for a duration that is sufficient to eliminate the infection.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite this, some patients still become resistant to treatment and other options have to be found. The best strategy for these cases is still under investigation.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c_vxvCY1_qc?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">6<a name="sec6"></a><strong>)<span style="color: #3366ff;"> Do new drugs have side effects?</span></strong><br>\r\nThe new drugs against hepatitis C, the so-called “second-generation DAAs”, are very well tolerated by patients and cause <strong>fewer, and much less severe, side effects</strong> than the previous treatments. Patients who were previously treated with earlier generations of medications report a significant difference.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, it cannot be said that this issue has been completely overcome. Many regimens still require<strong> interferons and/or ribavirin</strong> because of the characteristics of the virus and the stage of liver disease. The side effects of these drugs (anemia, low white cell count, headache, fatigue, skin rashes and so on) must be considered by all the patients for whom interferon and ribavirin-free treatment <strong>cannot be prescribed</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The risk of adverse events may always be considered an acceptable alternative to liver failure or cancer in patients with advanced liver disease. However for those without concurrent liver disease the risks associated with treatment may be less acceptable, as only a fraction of them will go on to develop serious consequences.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, safety data on new treatments are still limited, since <strong>post-marketing surveillance</strong> (i.e. the recording of any registered side effect when a drug is on the shelves) for most of these drugs has just begun. Post-marketing surveillance is always important, but even more so for new drugs such as these, which were approved very rapidly because of their ability to cure infection and save lives.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In the clinical trials, the rate of serious adverse events (resulting in persistent disability, hospital admission, or death) was very low (0,5-3%) . Such a<strong> small percentage</strong>, could still represent a significant<strong> absolute number</strong> of cases if millions of people are treated. Of the estimated 150 million people in world who are infected chronic HCV, this percentage of adverse events would represent 750, 000 to 4.5 million people affected.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treating hundreds of thousands people could also reveal <strong>rare side effects</strong> unlikely to be detected in trials with fewer participants.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the safety profile of these drugs needs to be evaluated in <strong>unselected patients</strong>, who can have other concurrent diseases, genetic characteristics, be of different ages and ethnic groups.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The main cause for concern at the moment is the risk of <strong>drug interactions</strong>. This kind of side effect can more easily emerge when treatment is given in the real world, where patients can have other diseases for which they take medications not considered during clinical trials.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">An example of this is the recent FDA advisory about <strong>amiodarone</strong>, a drug used to treat the irregular beating of the heart (arrhythmias). When taken with simeprevir and other antivirals, severe (even fatal) bradycardia has been reported prompting the US FDA to published an alert against the concomitant use of these two medications.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uUuTnWO0PWU?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><a name="sec7"></a></p>\r\n<p><strong>7) <span style="color: #3366ff;">Does co-infection with HIV change the management of hepatitis C?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a significant amount of stigma associated with HIV and HCV. Both are infectious diseases which in and of itself is sufficient to lead to stigma and discrimination, especially if the diseases and their methods of transmission are not well understood by the general public. Further, in certain countries the incidence of these viruses is highest among intravenous drug users.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Co-infection with HIV does not have an impact on the success rate of the new direct antivirals. However co-infected patients still require more attention because they have a higher risk of drug-drug interactions and their impaired immune systems could let the disease progress more quickly and aggressively.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>8<a name="sec8"></a><strong>) <span style="color: #3366ff;">Who determines dosage?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Optimal dosage and length of anti HCV treatments have been established in clinical trials. The recommended dosage is a set parameter, not to be changed. However, the degree of “aggressiveness” of a drug therapy can be changed by altering: 1) the number of drugs in the combination and 2) the length of treatment. “Overtreatment” may be advisable in real life settings for patients who are more difficult to cure. However, under-treatment without supporting evidence could lead to the emergence of dangerous resistant strains.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gNugNchJGUg?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><strong><a name="sec9"></a>9) <span style="color: #3366ff;">Who should be tested?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the vast majority of people are unaware of their condition because they are asymptomatic or experiencing symptoms too generic to arouse suspicion, patients must first be identified before addressing treatment issues. This can be done by <strong>screening</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There are controversial <strong>policy issues</strong> surrounding the ethics of screening, particularly if a country does not have the resources to treat the number of individuals that are expected to be identified. This is discussed at length in the<em> public policy module</em>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some countries recommend screening people with risk factors such as current or previous injection drug users or those who received blood transfusions prior to implementing safe screening strategies. Other countries recommend screening high risk groups, such as those born between 1945-1965 ― a generation that was more exposed to infection before the virus was identified.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As the risk of being infected is higher in these groups, the probability of finding patients with asymptomatic liver disease who would benefit from treatment is higher as well.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Encouraging everybody to get tested, would increase the number of infected people identified. Many of these individuals may have been well for decades (and maybe would have died of other causes before even knowing they were infected by HCV), but they are now suddenly told that they have a disease. Since transmission of HCV is not so easy in everyday life, and common hygienic habits are enough to avoid it, this revelation is unlikely to improve prevention measures markedly. However studies show that people diagnosed with HCV express relief in knowing about their disease as they feel more in control of avoiding infecting those they love. In addition, individuals who become aware of their infection can take measures to help limit further damage to their liver. There are many life style changes that an infected patient can adopt, such as no longer consuming alcohol.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h4KyRlpLhSk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>Add Charles gore video 13 in the policy section--------------------------------------</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a name="sec10"></a>10)<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"> Who should be treated?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that effective and tolerable treatments are available, many patients’ associations, doctors and experts worldwide feel that <strong>all the people infected with HCV</strong> should be treated, irrespective of the state of their liver or of the cost of treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">From a clinical point of view, the goal of treatment is to cure HCV patients of infection to prevent hepatic cirrhosis, or halt cirrhosis before the liver is too damaged to function, known as decompensated cirrhosis. Other long terms effects include liver cancer, and even severe health issues in other parts of the body – including autoimmune conditions and nephropathies, and death.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, the cure reduces the risk of decompensation and cancer. When a patient already has decompensated cirrhosis, the treatment can reduce the need for a liver transplantation. However, it should be noted that the impact on middle-to long term survival in these patients is still unknown.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the 2015 EASL guidelines, <strong>all patients with chronic liver disease</strong> due to HCV should be considered for treatment, with priorities associated to the severity of their condition.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment with an interferon-free regimen is urgent in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and should be prioritized in patients with significant fibrosis or cirrhosis, i.e. with F3 to F4 score on the METAVIR scale of liver disease severity.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In patients with no damage or mild disease the treatment can be either deferred or considered in particular cases of severity (HBV or HIV coinfection, significant extra-hepatic manifestations, debilitating fatigue) or when the risk of transmitting HCV to others is high.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Indications for treatment of chronic hepatitis C in 2015: Who should be treated and when?</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-5.gif"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2493 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-5.gif" alt="Table 5" height="1939" width="4077"></a></p>\r\n<p>Modified from EASL Recommendations on Treatment of Hepatitis C 2015</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qnSKUC7IPU4?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><a name="sec10"></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">10) <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Is eradication of hepatitis C the actual goal?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the availability of very effective treatments, complete<strong> eradication</strong> of hepatitis C from the world is not a realistic goal without a vaccine. A much more realistic goal is <strong>control</strong> of the disease, which can be achieved at least in high income countries, through prevention, diagnosis, a good healthcare system and access to drugs.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l4hdxRzmvDs?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><a name="sec11"></a>11.<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"> How much do these new drugs cost?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Negotiations between countries and pharmaceutical companies vary from one country to another. As a result, their price is different from drug to drug and from country to country.<br>\r\nIn the US, when sofosbuvir was introduced, each pill cost about 1000 dollars US, for a total price of 80.000-90.000 dollars for a cycle of 12 weeks.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In Europe different health systems have negotiated different prices, in some circumstances up to half the US price. In Italy, for example, a price/volume system of payment has been established, with the cost of drugs going down the more patients are treated.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In low income countries firms have agreed on a cheaper price. In Egypt a whole cycle of sofosbuvir costs about 500 US dollars. In India, Gilead (the company that owns sofosbuvir) has allowed 11 generic firms to produce the drug at low prices and sell it to about 90 developing countries, with a list of clauses to avoid illicit marketing towards middle and high-income countries.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zge-TvYFc9g?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>12)<a name="sec12"></a> <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">How is (and could) Hepatitis C be treated and managed in low and middle resources countries?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The challenge of Hepatitis C in low and middle income countries is not only about the price of drugs. There are other hurdles to face, such as traditional habits that hinder prevention and facilitate the transmission of the disease, the cost and difficulties of screening and the lack of medical resources. Hepatologists, for example, are very rare in Africa, but infectious disease specialists knowledgeable in liver diseases could be recruited. The network of institutions, facilities and staff built up to address HIV in many low and middle income countries could be now exploited to deal with HCV as well.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When an effective treatment to control AIDS was developed, it seemed costs would be prohibitive for low income countries. Instead, today, thanks to the efforts of governments, industry and non- governmental organizations, most patients who are diagnosed in the world can have access to treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The same result can hopefully be achieved for hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bSaLvzqsRmU?rel=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="341" width="604"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">REFERENCES</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Ghany MG, Strader DB, Thomas DL, Seeff LB; American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.

It can be caused by such things as bacteria, viruses, misuse of alcohol or toxins. Liver inflammation or damage can compromise liver function.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Acute Hepatitis </strong>C virus infection is a short-term illness that occurs within the first 6 months after someone is exposed to the Hepatitis C virus.

They are responsible for only 7% of the cases of viral hepatitis in the world.\n\nIn some rare cases <strong>adenovirus</strong>, <strong>cytomegalovirus</strong> (CMV), <strong>Epstein-Barr virus</strong> (EBV), or <strong>herpes simplex virus</strong> (HSV) can also cause hepatitis.\n\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2041 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-1.jpg" alt="Table 1" width="1894" height="2663" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis D</strong> is caused by Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV). Because HDV needs the hepatitis B virus to replicate and survive in the body, it can only be found in people already infected with HBV.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The HBV vaccine will therefore protect against both infections.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Like other hepatitis viruses, HDV is transmitted through contact with infected blood or blood products, semen, or other bodily fluids.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HDV infection of chronically infected HBV-carriers may lead to <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/hepatitis/whocdscsrncs20011/en/index7.html#fulminant">fulminant</a> acute hepatitis, a condition in which the liver produces a severe acute inflammatory response leading to extensive tissue damage and liver failure. It is 10 times more likely that fulminant acute hepatitis will develop in individuals co-infected with HDV and HBV than with other types of hepatitis viruses. It is also more likely for HDV/HDV co-infection to lead to severe chronic active hepatitis, increasing the risk of cirrhosis. Worldwide, more than 10 million people are infected with HDV, with a mortality rate between 2% and 20%, which is ten times higher than for hepatitis B alone.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis E</strong> is caused by Hepatitis E Virus, which infects about 20 million people in the world every year, leading to about 3 million cases of acute hepatitis.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is transmitted mainly through contaminated drinking water worldwide, and is more common in East and South Asia. It usually resolves within 4–6 weeks, but in some cases can lead to a fulminant form of hepatitis, responsible for 56,600 deaths in the world every year.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The first vaccine to prevent hepatitis E virus infection has been produced and licensed in China, but is not yet available globally.</p>\n\n\n<hr />\n<p style="text-align: justify;">5.<strong><a name="sec5"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How can different viral hepatitis be transmitted and how can transmission be prevented?</span></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis A</strong> is transmitted through <strong>ingestion</strong> of microscopic amounts of fecal material, such as through contaminated food, drink, and objects.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis A transmission happens mainly by:</p>\n\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">eating fruits, vegetables, or other foods contaminated during handling</li>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">eating raw shellfish harvested from contaminated water</li>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">swallowing contaminated ice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">These at-risk behaviours should be avoided to prevent transmission, particularly when travelling to countries that have a high or intermediate prevalence of the disease.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vaccination is t</strong>he most effective way to prevent Hepatitis A.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis B</strong> is transmitted by contact with infected blood, semen, or other <strong>body fluids</strong>.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis B transmission can therefore happen by:</p>\n\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">being born to an infected mother</li>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">having sexual intercourse with an infected person</li>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">sharing contaminated needles, syringes, or other injection drug equipment</li>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">being accidentally pricked by contaminated needlesticks or other sharp instruments (i.e healthcare professionals).</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventative measures established for other blood and sexually transmitted diseases, both in healthcare and in everyday life, should be adopted to prevent Hepatitis B transmission.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Like Hepatitis A, the most effective way to prevent Hepatitis B is <strong>vaccination</strong>.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis C</strong> is spread through blood-to-blood contact. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water. Nor is it spread through casual contact, such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Infection can happen by:</p>\n\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\n	<li>sharing contaminated needles, syringes, or other injection drug equipment</li>\n	<li>being accidentally pricked by contaminated needlesticks or other sharp instruments (i.e healthcare professionals)</li>\n	<li>having received a blood transfusion or organ transplant before the early 1990s in developed countries — when widespread screening for HCV was introduced with increasing levels of efficacy at detecting the virus. In low resource countries, blood safety remains an issue of major concern.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Birth to an infected mother is a less common mode of transmission. According to US Centers for Disease prevention and Control (CDC), approximately 6% of infants born to infected mothers will get Hepatitis C.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV infection can only be prevented by avoiding blood-to-blood contacts.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventative measures should also include getting tattoes and piercings in certified facilities that use sterile instruments. Healthcare workers should follow professional preventative guidelines.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV cannot usually be transmitted sexually. Nevertheless, even if sexual transmission is very uncommon, practices involving blood contact should be considered <em>at risk</em> behaviors. Having a sexually transmitted disease or HIV, having sex with multiple partners, or engaging in rough sex appears to increase a person’s risk of getting Hepatitis C.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Sharing razors and toothbrushes can expose an individual to infection as well.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Still, about 1 out of 4 patients does not know how or when he or she was infected.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a><sup><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"></a></sup></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">People who have recovered from acute hepatitis C and those who have been cured must be careful about prevention, since reinfection is possible.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is as yet, no proven vaccine for HCV.</p>\n\n\n<hr />\n<p style="text-align: justify;">6.<strong><a name="sec6"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Why don’t we have a vaccine for HCV?</span></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A vaccine contains a biological agent that is usually an attenuated or replication-deficient version of a disease causing organism. Exposure to this agent will safely stimulate an individual’s immune system to acquire an immunity to the microorganism without causing disease. HCV is a difficult virus to produce a vaccine for because of its genetic diversity. As such, it is a challenge for scientists to find a target on the virus that is common across HCV genotypes and subgenotypes.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In contrast, HBV is easily recognized by the protein called Antigen Australia (HBsAg), and an immunological response against HbsAg can stop the infection, but researchers have not yet found such a promising target in the structure of HCV.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The first vaccine for HCV to reach clinical trials was found to be safe and produced a good immune response in the 15 healthy human volunteers who took part in the phase 1 safety trial. Its efficacy is currently under investigation among intravenous drug users in two sites in the USA. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr />\n<p style="text-align: justify;">7.<strong><a name="sec7"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Can blood transfusions still transmit HCV today?</span></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In developed countries<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a>, the first blood test for HCV was introduced in 1990. This test could detect antibodies against HCV proteins. In the USA, screening blood from donors with this HCV test decreased the risk of transfusion-associated HCV infection per unit of blood from 0.36% (1 in 274) to 0.07% (1 in 3300). Today it is estimated that this test has prevented transmission of HCV to 40,000 patients per year in the US. This test wasn’t perfect. Antibodies to HCV weren’t detectable in the blood for at least 12 weeks after infection, and sometimes more than 26 weeks. During this window, tainted blood could therefore appear safe.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A second-generation more sensitive test, able to detect infected blood as early as 10-20 days post infection, was developed and approved in 1992 . It is estimated that this new test prevented an additional 13,000 people from becoming infected with HCV each year.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/history-of-postransfusion-hep.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2058 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/history-of-postransfusion-hep.jpg" alt="history of postransfusion hep" width="567" height="454" /></a></span>Globally<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a>, blood transfusions are not yet as safe as they are in higher-income countries.

These differences are based on major viral genetic characteristics, i.e. differences in the genetic sequence that may affect functional features of the virus and how it will respond to pharmacological treatments or antiviral drugs like interferon.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Other, more minor, variants can be found within each genotype; HCV is further classified into 67 confirmed and 20 provisional subtypes. The genetic differences between subtypes are more subtle, but these still need to be considered since these can sometimes influence the virus’s response to different kinds of treatments . In genotype 1, for example, the difference between genotype 1a and 1b is relevant in terms of anticipated treatment response and must therefore be assessed before initiating treatment.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The high degree of genetic diversity of HCV continues to pose a significant challenge for achieving successful vaccines and drug therapies that are effective for all genotypes and subtypes, the so-called pan-genotypic treatment. Such an option would be of particularinterest in developing countries, where genotype testing is often unreliable or difficult to perform.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/most-common-genotypes.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2062 alignnone" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/most-common-genotypes-300x188.jpg" alt="most common genotypes" width="450" height="282" /></a></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some current treatments are said to be pan-genotypic, but in the real world they have different degrees of effectiveness for different genotypes and are not approved for all of them (<em>see</em> treatment module). Doses, length of treatment, and rate of success still partly depend on HCV genotype, and sometimes subtype. Alternative drugs with broader efficacy are currently under investigation.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is possible for a person to be infected with more than one genotype.</p>\n<p class="alignleft" style="text-align: justify;">Globally, the most common genotype is G1 (42% of all HCV cases), followed by G3 (26%) and G4 (17%). The most common subtype is 1b (27%).</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Global distribution of different genotypes shows different prevalence in different areas of the world.</p>\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence-map_genotypes.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2063 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence-map_genotypes.jpg" alt="prevalence map_genotypes" width="950" height="404" /></a><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Map taken from Messina et al, 2014 (Fig 1A)</strong></span>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Genotype 1 (subtype 1b), is the most prevalent genotype in higher income countries, followed by genotype 3.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The global distribution of HCV genetic variation could be related to historical and contemporary trends in human migration. For example, strains from West Africa (genotype 2) could have been brought to the Americas through the trans-Atlantic slave trade.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One possible explanation for the global distribution of genotype 1 is its association with the most common cause of HCV infection in the 20th century — the distribution of contaminated blood and blood products before HCV screening of blood began. In fact, genotype 1 is prevalent in developed countries, where blood transfusions were more available and widespread: a hypothesis is that the most common sources of blood in those years were from areas where this genotype was prevalent.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The global dissemination of genotype 3 is more likely to be attributed to the association of subtype 3a with injection drug use and to population migration in United Kingdom during colonialism from countries where subtype 3a is dominant, such as India and Pakistan.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if genotype 1 and 3 infections are more prevalent than all other genotypes globally. Genotypes found more commonly in lower-income countries still account for a significant proportion of HCV cases worldwide. Specifically, genotype 2 is most frequent in West Africa and parts of South America (the latter likely reflecting population movements resulting from the trans-Atlantic slave trade), while genotypes 4 and 6 are common in Central/North Africa and East/Southeast Asia, respectively.</p>\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/be-aware-box_1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2070 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/be-aware-box_1.jpg" alt="be aware box_1" width="1205" height="378" /></a>\n\n<hr />\n<p style="text-align: justify;">10.<strong><a name="sec10"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are the symptoms of hepatitis C?</span></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Most people with hepatitis C do not have symptoms and do not know they are infected until their liver has sustained significant damage.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A chronic viral hepatitis infection can present without any symptoms for decades.\nHowever, it is possible to experience the following symptoms:</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>feeling unusually tired all the time</li>\n	<li>depression</li>\n	<li>jaundice</li>\n	<li>a general sense of feeling unwell</li>\n	<li>abdominal pain or bloating</li>\n	<li>loss of memory</li>\n	<li>itchy skin</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Since these symptoms are very vague, and similar to those reported in many other common diseases, people are often unaware of their condition until they develop cirrhosis, when scar tissue replaces healthy tissue in the liver and prevents the liver from working properly.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The early stages of cirrhosis can be as insidious as the previous phases, with very few or no symptoms experienced by the individual, but as the liver loses its ability to function properly, a loss of appetite, nausea and itchy skin become more and more common.\nAs the disease progresses, and liver functions are affected, many new symptoms tend to develop:</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">weight loss and muscle wasting</li>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">tenderness or pain around the liver area</li>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">blood capillaries on the skin above waist level</li>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">a tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequent nosebleeds or bleeding gums</li>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">hair loss</li>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">fever and shivering attacks</li>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">swelling in the legs, ankles and feet due to a build-up of fluid (edema)</li>\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">swelling in abdomen, due to a build-up of fluid known as ascites</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Changes in personality, insomnia, memory loss, confusion and difficulty concentrating are caused by an encephalopathy that can occur when toxins affect the brain, because the liver is unable to remove them from the body.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">11.<strong><a name="sec11"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How often does the disease progress into a chronic infection and what happens to the liver?</span></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the WHO, at least 15% of infected persons spontaneously clear the virus within 6 months of infection, without any treatment.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The remaining 55–85% of persons will develop a chronic HCV infection. When chronic Hepatitis C develops, it can result in long-term health problems, including liver damage, liver failure, liver cancer, and even death.\nOf those with chronic HCV infection, the risk of cirrhosis of the liver is 15–30% within 20 years.\nChronic hepatitis C is the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer and the most common reason for liver transplantation in the United States.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">For every 100 persons infected with HCV, approximately 1–5 will die from the consequences of chronic infection (liver cancer or cirrhosis) (source CDC).</p>\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/z_liver-damage_timeline_1-flat-small.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2036 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/z_liver-damage_timeline_1-flat-small.jpg" alt="liver damage_timeline_final" width="2508" height="1751" /></a>\n\nbased on http://www.hepatitisc.uw.edu/go/evaluation-staging-monitoring/natural-history/core-concept/all\n\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCyoHQ-KKaw?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> 12.<strong><a name="sec12"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How can Hepatitis C be diagnosed?</span></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In most cases infection is identified when the patient is screened for blood donation or when elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT, a liver enzyme) levels are detected during routine medical exams.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When HCV infection is suspected, a blood test is performed to search for antibodies against HCV. If the test detects the presence of antibodies, a second test is performed to directly establish whether the virus itself is currently present in the individual.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/org-chart_good-one2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2279 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/org-chart_good-one2.jpg" alt="org chart_good one2" width="907" height="2750" /></a></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">...</p>\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9S1ycVi9gA?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C is based on the detection of both anti-HCV antibodies and direct detection of the HCV virus in the presence of biological (i.e. abnormal levels of liver enzymes in blood tests) or histological (that can be seen examining small parts of liver tissue taken by biopsy) signs of chronic hepatitis.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Having anti-HCV antibodies (anti-HCV positive) in blood does not necessarily mean that an individual has an active hepatitis C infection. The presence of antibodies is an indication that a person has at some point in the past mounted an immune response againt HCV. Approximately 20% of the infected people clear the virus within 6 months, and these individuals will continue to carry antibodies againt HCV. Anti-HCV-positive, HCV RNA negative individuals should be retested for HCV RNA three months later to confirm true convalescence. After that, they are not considered to have hepatitis C. Although no longer infected, they will still test positive for anti-HCV antibodies all their lives. Since they don’t host the virus in their blood, they cannot spread the disease.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the presence of both anti-HCV antibodies and the HCV virus in blood indicates the presence of a hepatitis C infection and, consequently, that the person is infectious. If the direct HCV test is negative within 6 months, the patient had acute hepatitis C. If the test continues to yield positive results beyond 6 months, the patient is diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">After that time, it is very rare for the immune system to clear the virus and for the test to be negative.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, HCV antibodies are not protective against reinfection, which can occur after successful treatment as well (See <em>Treatment</em> module for more information).</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2283 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2.jpg" alt="Table 2" width="2033" height="556" /></a>A laboratory test for identifying the genotype (and 1a/1b subtype) of the hepatitis C strain and an assessment of liver damage will guide treatment choices.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Establishing the amount of virus present, or the “viral load” can also help predict a treatment’s success.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A test of the patient’s DNA can help determine how effective certain drugs can be against HCV. Variants of a gene involved in the immune response against HCV (Interleukin 28B, IL28B), can alter the effect of certain HCV treatments (See Treatment module).</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">13.<span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff;" name="sec13"></a>How can liver damage be assessed?</strong></span></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main factors influencing the type and timing of treatment is the severity of liver disease.\nPatients with cirrhosis have to be identified since their treatment regimen needs to be adapted accordingly. The fibrosis stage can be assessed initially with imaging (ultrasound scan, MRI,…), liver stiffness measurement, and identification of biomarkers in the blood.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Liver stiffness measurement (FibroScan®) measures how quickly vibrations pass through the liver. The more ‘stiff’ or damaged the liver is, the more quickly the waves will pass through it .</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Blood biomarkers include several direct markers which correlate with, or are part of, the liver matrix that is produced in the fibrosis process. Other indirect markers reflect changes in liver function. They are molecules released into the blood when there is inflammation of the liver.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Both stiffness measurement and biomarkers can distinguish quite well between cirrhosis and no-fibrosis. Combined, these tests can identify intermediate degrees of fibrosis. These tests reduce the need for an invasive liver biopsy, a procedure that can be problematic for patients with impaired blood clotting capacity.\nIn patients without compromised blood clotting, there is little risk of hemorrage from a liver biopsy, since it involves taking a small tissue sample from the liver though the skin by percutaneous core needle, under ultrasound guide. This tissue sample is then examined under a microscope.</p>\n14.<strong><a name="sec14"></a> How is Hepatitis C treated and managed?</strong>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When a diagnosis of Hepatitis C is confirmed, the presence or absence of other diseases must be established since this can influence prognosis and treatment. Mycotoxins, as well as alcohol, can make the evolution of the disease more severe. A concurrent infection with HIV, for example, can require a different approach with different drugs, and possible drug interactions must also be considered.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The degree of liver damage and virus genotype are used to drive treatment and management of the disease (see treatment module).</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A therapy’s success is evaluated by blood tests showing no detectable virus. A sustained virus response (SVR), is the continued absence of detectable HCV virus in the blood six months (24 weeks) after the end of treatment.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The antiviral Interferon-α was the the first drug treatment for HCV after it was discovered in 1989. In 2011, a more persistent form of interferon-α (Pegylated interferon- α), together with the antiviral drug ribavirin, increased the rates of success. These, however, never exceeded a 50% cure rate, and their heavy side effects often forced patients to discontinue the treatment.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2011, new antivirals called Direct Agent Antivirals (DAA, i.e. protease inhibitors acting directly on the virus instead of on the patient) were introduced, to be given in association with previous drugs (triple therapy regimen). They improved the SVR in up to 75% of patients, but with even worse side effects.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All these therapies were more effective on other genotypes than on genotype 1, the most common in higher income countries. Substantial research efforts led to a new class of DAA. The first to be introduced was sofosbuvir in 2014. The new therapies are even more effective on genotype 1 than on others, approaching 95% of success rates in clinical trials with fewer and milder side effects.\nNow, the real challenge is providing access to these revolutionary drugs (please refer to Treatment section for success rates of the DAA in other genotypes). They are very expensive and on a global scale most healthcare systems and patients cannot afford them.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This has made hepatitis C therapy more a policy issue than a medical one.</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9S1ycVi9gA?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>REFERENCES</strong>\n\nPrati, D.

It can be caused by such things as bacteria, viruses, misuse of alcohol or toxins. Liver inflammation or damage can compromise liver function.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Acute Hepatitis </strong>C virus infection is a short-term illness that occurs within the first 6 months after someone is exposed to the Hepatitis C virus. For most people, acute infection leads to chronic infection.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chronic Hepatitis</strong> C virus infection is a long-term illness that occurs when the Hepatitis C virus remains in a person’s body. Hepatitis C virus infection can last a lifetime and lead to serious liver problems, including cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) or liver cancer.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This is because inflammation sustained over an extended period of time leads to liver damage, and repeated attempts to repair the tissue can result in the formation of scars of fibrous tissue.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Liver failure occurs When the liver cannot keep up with the body’s needs anymore, a condition that can be life-threatening and can be cured only by a liver transplant.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">2. <strong><a name="sec2"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Why is the liver so important ?

In this case it is called <strong>Viral Hepatitis</strong>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n4.<strong><a name="sec4"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Which viruses can cause Viral Hepatitis?</span></strong>\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fB52q9fc-As?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe know several viruses that can cause viral hepatitis:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>hepatitis A virus (HAV): Please refer to table 1 for detailed information about HAV</li>\r\n	<li>hepatitis B virus (HBV). Please refer to table 1 for detailed information about HBV</li>\r\n	<li>hepatitis C virus (HCV). Please refer to table 1 for detailed information about HCV</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe most important viruses causing hepatitis are Hepatitis A, B and C.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hepatitis delta virus</strong> (HDV) and <strong>hepatitis E virus</strong> (HEV), are much less common. They are responsible for only 7% of the cases of viral hepatitis in the world.\r\n\r\nIn some rare cases <strong>adenovirus</strong>, <strong>cytomegalovirus</strong> (CMV), <strong>Epstein-Barr virus</strong> (EBV), or <strong>herpes simplex virus</strong> (HSV) can also cause hepatitis.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2041 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-1.jpg" alt="Table 1" width="1894" height="2663" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis D</strong> is caused by Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV). Because HDV needs the hepatitis B virus to replicate and survive in the body, it can only be found in people already infected with HBV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The HBV vaccine will therefore protect against both infections.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Like other hepatitis viruses, HDV is transmitted through contact with infected blood or blood products, semen, or other bodily fluids.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HDV infection of chronically infected HBV-carriers may lead to <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/hepatitis/whocdscsrncs20011/en/index7.html#fulminant">fulminant</a> acute hepatitis, a condition in which the liver produces a severe acute inflammatory response leading to extensive tissue damage and liver failure. It is 10 times more likely that fulminant acute hepatitis will develop in individuals co-infected with HDV and HBV than with other types of hepatitis viruses. It is also more likely for HDV/HDV co-infection to lead to severe chronic active hepatitis, increasing the risk of cirrhosis. Worldwide, more than 10 million people are infected with HDV, with a mortality rate between 2% and 20%, which is ten times higher than for hepatitis B alone.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis E</strong> is caused by Hepatitis E Virus, which infects about 20 million people in the world every year, leading to about 3 million cases of acute hepatitis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is transmitted mainly through contaminated drinking water worldwide, and is more common in East and South Asia. It usually resolves within 4–6 weeks, but in some cases can lead to a fulminant form of hepatitis, responsible for 56,600 deaths in the world every year.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The first vaccine to prevent hepatitis E virus infection has been produced and licensed in China, but is not yet available globally.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">5.<strong><a name="sec5"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How can different viral hepatitis be transmitted and how can transmission be prevented?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis A</strong> is transmitted through <strong>ingestion</strong> of microscopic amounts of fecal material, such as through contaminated food, drink, and objects.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis A transmission happens mainly by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">eating fruits, vegetables, or other foods contaminated during handling</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">eating raw shellfish harvested from contaminated water</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">swallowing contaminated ice.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">These at-risk behaviours should be avoided to prevent transmission, particularly when travelling to countries that have a high or intermediate prevalence of the disease.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vaccination is t</strong>he most effective way to prevent Hepatitis A.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis B</strong> is transmitted by contact with infected blood, semen, or other <strong>body fluids</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis B transmission can therefore happen by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">being born to an infected mother</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">having sexual intercourse with an infected person</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">sharing contaminated needles, syringes, or other injection drug equipment</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">being accidentally pricked by contaminated needlesticks or other sharp instruments (i.e healthcare professionals).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventative measures established for other blood and sexually transmitted diseases, both in healthcare and in everyday life, should be adopted to prevent Hepatitis B transmission.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Like Hepatitis A, the most effective way to prevent Hepatitis B is <strong>vaccination</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis C</strong> is spread through blood-to-blood contact. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water. Nor is it spread through casual contact, such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Infection can happen by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li>sharing contaminated needles, syringes, or other injection drug equipment</li>\r\n	<li>being accidentally pricked by contaminated needlesticks or other sharp instruments (i.e healthcare professionals)</li>\r\n	<li>having received a blood transfusion or organ transplant before the early 1990s in developed countries — when widespread screening for HCV was introduced with increasing levels of efficacy at detecting the virus. In low resource countries, blood safety remains an issue of major concern.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Birth to an infected mother is a less common mode of transmission. According to US Centers for Disease prevention and Control (CDC), approximately 6% of infants born to infected mothers will get Hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV infection can only be prevented by avoiding blood-to-blood contacts.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventative measures should also include getting tattoes and piercings in certified facilities that use sterile instruments. Healthcare workers should follow professional preventative guidelines.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV cannot usually be transmitted sexually. Nevertheless, even if sexual transmission is very uncommon, practices involving blood contact should be considered <em>at risk</em> behaviors. Having a sexually transmitted disease or HIV, having sex with multiple partners, or engaging in rough sex appears to increase a person’s risk of getting Hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Sharing razors and toothbrushes can expose an individual to infection as well.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Still, about 1 out of 4 patients does not know how or when he or she was infected.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a><sup><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"></a></sup></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">People who have recovered from acute hepatitis C and those who have been cured must be careful about prevention, since reinfection is possible.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is as yet, no proven vaccine for HCV.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">6.<strong><a name="sec6"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Why don’t we have a vaccine for HCV?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A vaccine contains a biological agent that is usually an attenuated or replication-deficient version of a disease causing organism. Exposure to this agent will safely stimulate an individual’s immune system to acquire an immunity to the microorganism without causing disease. HCV is a difficult virus to produce a vaccine for because of its genetic diversity. As such, it is a challenge for scientists to find a target on the virus that is common across HCV genotypes and subgenotypes.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In contrast, HBV is easily recognized by the protein called Antigen Australia (HBsAg), and an immunological response against HbsAg can stop the infection, but researchers have not yet found such a promising target in the structure of HCV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The first vaccine for HCV to reach clinical trials was found to be safe and produced a good immune response in the 15 healthy human volunteers who took part in the phase 1 safety trial. Its efficacy is currently under investigation among intravenous drug users in two sites in the USA. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">7.<strong><a name="sec7"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Can blood transfusions still transmit HCV today?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In developed countries<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a>, the first blood test for HCV was introduced in 1990. This test could detect antibodies against HCV proteins. In the USA, screening blood from donors with this HCV test decreased the risk of transfusion-associated HCV infection per unit of blood from 0.36% (1 in 274) to 0.07% (1 in 3300). Today it is estimated that this test has prevented transmission of HCV to 40,000 patients per year in the US. This test wasn’t perfect. Antibodies to HCV weren’t detectable in the blood for at least 12 weeks after infection, and sometimes more than 26 weeks. During this window, tainted blood could therefore appear safe.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A second-generation more sensitive test, able to detect infected blood as early as 10-20 days post infection, was developed and approved in 1992 . It is estimated that this new test prevented an additional 13,000 people from becoming infected with HCV each year.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/history-of-postransfusion-hep.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2058 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/history-of-postransfusion-hep.jpg" alt="history of postransfusion hep" width="567" height="454" /></a></span>Globally<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a>, blood transfusions are not yet as safe as they are in higher-income countries. Of 148 countries that provided WHO data for screening, 41 reported that they lacked the resources to screen all donated blood for one or more of the required transfusion-transmitted diseases (HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In sub-Saharan Africa, 28 out of the 40 countries have yet to implement national quality systems needed to assure effective screening of donated blood. WHO estimates that the lack of effective screening results in up to 5 million new infections of hepatitis C every year in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">8.<strong><a name="sec8"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are the challenges of HCV prevention in lower income countries?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The transmission of hepatitis C persists in most parts of Africa, as well as in other parts of the world, primarily because of traditional habits and a lack of resources in healthcare settings.</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h3Z8DuJnwWM?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> 9.<strong><a name="sec9"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are HCV genotypes, how many strains do we know and how common are they?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There are 7 main genotypes of Hepatitis C . These differences are based on major viral genetic characteristics, i.e. differences in the genetic sequence that may affect functional features of the virus and how it will respond to pharmacological treatments or antiviral drugs like interferon.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Other, more minor, variants can be found within each genotype; HCV is further classified into 67 confirmed and 20 provisional subtypes. The genetic differences between subtypes are more subtle, but these still need to be considered since these can sometimes influence the virus’s response to different kinds of treatments . In genotype 1, for example, the difference between genotype 1a and 1b is relevant in terms of anticipated treatment response and must therefore be assessed before initiating treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The high degree of genetic diversity of HCV continues to pose a significant challenge for achieving successful vaccines and drug therapies that are effective for all genotypes and subtypes, the so-called pan-genotypic treatment. Such an option would be of particularinterest in developing countries, where genotype testing is often unreliable or difficult to perform.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/most-common-genotypes.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2062 alignnone" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/most-common-genotypes-300x188.jpg" alt="most common genotypes" width="450" height="282" /></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some current treatments are said to be pan-genotypic, but in the real world they have different degrees of effectiveness for different genotypes and are not approved for all of them (<em>see</em> treatment module). Doses, length of treatment, and rate of success still partly depend on HCV genotype, and sometimes subtype. Alternative drugs with broader efficacy are currently under investigation.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is possible for a person to be infected with more than one genotype.</p>\r\n<p class="alignleft" style="text-align: justify;">Globally, the most common genotype is G1 (42% of all HCV cases), followed by G3 (26%) and G4 (17%). The most common subtype is 1b (27%).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Global distribution of different genotypes shows different prevalence in different areas of the world.</p>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence-map_genotypes.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2063 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence-map_genotypes.jpg" alt="prevalence map_genotypes" width="950" height="404" /></a><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Map taken from Messina et al, 2014 (Fig 1A)</strong></span>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Genotype 1 (subtype 1b), is the most prevalent genotype in higher income countries, followed by genotype 3.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The global distribution of HCV genetic variation could be related to historical and contemporary trends in human migration. For example, strains from West Africa (genotype 2) could have been brought to the Americas through the trans-Atlantic slave trade.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One possible explanation for the global distribution of genotype 1 is its association with the most common cause of HCV infection in the 20th century — the distribution of contaminated blood and blood products before HCV screening of blood began. In fact, genotype 1 is prevalent in developed countries, where blood transfusions were more available and widespread: a hypothesis is that the most common sources of blood in those years were from areas where this genotype was prevalent.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The global dissemination of genotype 3 is more likely to be attributed to the association of subtype 3a with injection drug use and to population migration in United Kingdom during colonialism from countries where subtype 3a is dominant, such as India and Pakistan.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if genotype 1 and 3 infections are more prevalent than all other genotypes globally. Genotypes found more commonly in lower-income countries still account for a significant proportion of HCV cases worldwide. Specifically, genotype 2 is most frequent in West Africa and parts of South America (the latter likely reflecting population movements resulting from the trans-Atlantic slave trade), while genotypes 4 and 6 are common in Central/North Africa and East/Southeast Asia, respectively.</p>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/be-aware-box_1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2070 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/be-aware-box_1.jpg" alt="be aware box_1" width="1205" height="378" /></a>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">10.<strong><a name="sec10"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are the symptoms of hepatitis C?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Most people with hepatitis C do not have symptoms and do not know they are infected until their liver has sustained significant damage.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A chronic viral hepatitis infection can present without any symptoms for decades.\r\nHowever, it is possible to experience the following symptoms:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>feeling unusually tired all the time</li>\r\n	<li>depression</li>\r\n	<li>jaundice</li>\r\n	<li>a general sense of feeling unwell</li>\r\n	<li>abdominal pain or bloating</li>\r\n	<li>loss of memory</li>\r\n	<li>itchy skin</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Since these symptoms are very vague, and similar to those reported in many other common diseases, people are often unaware of their condition until they develop cirrhosis, when scar tissue replaces healthy tissue in the liver and prevents the liver from working properly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The early stages of cirrhosis can be as insidious as the previous phases, with very few or no symptoms experienced by the individual, but as the liver loses its ability to function properly, a loss of appetite, nausea and itchy skin become more and more common.\r\nAs the disease progresses, and liver functions are affected, many new symptoms tend to develop:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">weight loss and muscle wasting</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">tenderness or pain around the liver area</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">blood capillaries on the skin above waist level</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">a tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequent nosebleeds or bleeding gums</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">hair loss</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">fever and shivering attacks</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">swelling in the legs, ankles and feet due to a build-up of fluid (edema)</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">swelling in abdomen, due to a build-up of fluid known as ascites</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Changes in personality, insomnia, memory loss, confusion and difficulty concentrating are caused by an encephalopathy that can occur when toxins affect the brain, because the liver is unable to remove them from the body.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">11.<a name="sec11"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How often does the disease progress into a chronic infection and what happens to the liver?</span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the WHO, at least 15% of infected persons spontaneously clear the virus within 6 months of infection, without any treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The remaining 55–85% of persons will develop a chronic HCV infection. When chronic Hepatitis C develops, it can result in long-term health problems, including liver damage, liver failure, liver cancer, and even death.\r\nOf those with chronic HCV infection, the risk of cirrhosis of the liver is 15–30% within 20 years.\r\nChronic hepatitis C is the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer and the most common reason for liver transplantation in the United States.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">For every 100 persons infected with HCV, approximately 1–5 will die from the consequences of chronic infection (liver cancer or cirrhosis) (source CDC).</p>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/z_liver-damage_timeline_1-flat-small.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2036 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/z_liver-damage_timeline_1-flat-small.jpg" alt="liver damage_timeline_final" width="2508" height="1751" /></a>\r\n\r\nbased on http://www.hepatitisc.uw.edu/go/evaluation-staging-monitoring/natural-history/core-concept/all\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCyoHQ-KKaw?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> 12.<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">How can Hepatitis C be diagnosed?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In most cases infection is identified when the patient is screened for blood donation or when elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT, a liver enzyme) levels are detected during routine medical exams.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When HCV infection is suspected, a blood test is performed to search for antibodies against HCV. If the test detects the presence of antibodies, a second test is performed to directly establish whether the virus itself is currently present in the individual.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/org-chart_good-one2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2279 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/org-chart_good-one2.jpg" alt="org chart_good one2" width="907" height="2750" /></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">...</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9S1ycVi9gA?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C is based on the detection of both anti-HCV antibodies and direct detection of the HCV virus in the presence of biological (i.e. abnormal levels of liver enzymes in blood tests) or histological (that can be seen examining small parts of liver tissue taken by biopsy) signs of chronic hepatitis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Having anti-HCV antibodies (anti-HCV positive) in blood does not necessarily mean that an individual has an active hepatitis C infection. The presence of antibodies is an indication that a person has at some point in the past mounted an immune response againt HCV. Approximately 20% of the infected people clear the virus within 6 months, and these individuals will continue to carry antibodies againt HCV. Anti-HCV-positive, HCV RNA negative individuals should be retested for HCV RNA three months later to confirm true convalescence. After that, they are not considered to have hepatitis C. Although no longer infected, they will still test positive for anti-HCV antibodies all their lives. Since they don’t host the virus in their blood, they cannot spread the disease.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the presence of both anti-HCV antibodies and the HCV virus in blood indicates the presence of a hepatitis C infection and, consequently, that the person is infectious. If the direct HCV test is negative within 6 months, the patient had acute hepatitis C. If the test continues to yield positive results beyond 6 months, the patient is diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">After that time, it is very rare for the immune system to clear the virus and for the test to be negative.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, HCV antibodies are not protective against reinfection, which can occur after successful treatment as well (See <em>Treatment</em> module for more information).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2283 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2.jpg" alt="Table 2" width="2033" height="556" /></a>A laboratory test for identifying the genotype (and 1a/1b subtype) of the hepatitis C strain and an assessment of liver damage will guide treatment choices.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Establishing the amount of virus present, or the “viral load” can also help predict a treatment’s success.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A test of the patient’s DNA can help determine how effective certain drugs can be against HCV. Variants of a gene involved in the immune response against HCV (Interleukin 28B, IL28B), can alter the effect of certain HCV treatments (See Treatment module).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">13.<span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff;" name="sec13"></a>How can liver damage be assessed?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main factors influencing the type and timing of treatment is the severity of liver disease.\r\nPatients with cirrhosis have to be identified since their treatment regimen needs to be adapted accordingly. The fibrosis stage can be assessed initially with imaging (ultrasound scan, MRI,…), liver stiffness measurement, and identification of biomarkers in the blood.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Liver stiffness measurement (FibroScan®) measures how quickly vibrations pass through the liver. The more ‘stiff’ or damaged the liver is, the more quickly the waves will pass through it .</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Blood biomarkers include several direct markers which correlate with, or are part of, the liver matrix that is produced in the fibrosis process. Other indirect markers reflect changes in liver function. They are molecules released into the blood when there is inflammation of the liver.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Both stiffness measurement and biomarkers can distinguish quite well between cirrhosis and no-fibrosis. Combined, these tests can identify intermediate degrees of fibrosis. These tests reduce the need for an invasive liver biopsy, a procedure that can be problematic for patients with impaired blood clotting capacity.\r\nIn patients without compromised blood clotting, there is little risk of hemorrage from a liver biopsy, since it involves taking a small tissue sample from the liver though the skin by percutaneous core needle, under ultrasound guide. This tissue sample is then examined under a microscope.</p>\r\n14.<strong><a name="sec14"></a> How is Hepatitis C treated and managed?</strong>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When a diagnosis of Hepatitis C is confirmed, the presence or absence of other diseases must be established since this can influence prognosis and treatment. Mycotoxins, as well as alcohol, can make the evolution of the disease more severe. A concurrent infection with HIV, for example, can require a different approach with different drugs, and possible drug interactions must also be considered.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The degree of liver damage and virus genotype are used to drive treatment and management of the disease (see treatment module).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A therapy’s success is evaluated by blood tests showing no detectable virus. A sustained virus response (SVR), is the continued absence of detectable HCV virus in the blood six months (24 weeks) after the end of treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The antiviral Interferon-α was the the first drug treatment for HCV after it was discovered in 1989. In 2011, a more persistent form of interferon-α (Pegylated interferon- α), together with the antiviral drug ribavirin, increased the rates of success. These, however, never exceeded a 50% cure rate, and their heavy side effects often forced patients to discontinue the treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2011, new antivirals called Direct Agent Antivirals (DAA, i.e. protease inhibitors acting directly on the virus instead of on the patient) were introduced, to be given in association with previous drugs (triple therapy regimen). They improved the SVR in up to 75% of patients, but with even worse side effects.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All these therapies were more effective on other genotypes than on genotype 1, the most common in higher income countries. Substantial research efforts led to a new class of DAA. The first to be introduced was sofosbuvir in 2014. The new therapies are even more effective on genotype 1 than on others, approaching 95% of success rates in clinical trials with fewer and milder side effects.\r\nNow, the real challenge is providing access to these revolutionary drugs (please refer to Treatment section for success rates of the DAA in other genotypes). They are very expensive and on a global scale most healthcare systems and patients cannot afford them.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This has made hepatitis C therapy more a policy issue than a medical one.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9S1ycVi9gA?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>REFERENCES</strong>\r\n\r\nPrati, D.

Liver inflammation or damage can compromise liver function.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Acute Hepatitis </strong>C virus infection is a short-term illness that occurs within the first 6 months after someone is exposed to the Hepatitis C virus. For most people, acute infection leads to chronic infection.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chronic Hepatitis</strong> C virus infection is a long-term illness that occurs when the Hepatitis C virus remains in a person’s body. Hepatitis C virus infection can last a lifetime and lead to serious liver problems, including cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) or liver cancer.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This is because inflammation sustained over an extended period of time leads to liver damage, and repeated attempts to repair the tissue can result in the formation of scars of fibrous tissue.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Liver failure occurs When the liver cannot keep up with the body’s needs anymore, a condition that can be life-threatening and can be cured only by a liver transplant.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">2. <strong><a name="sec2"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Why is the liver so important ?

Because HDV needs the hepatitis B virus to replicate and survive in the body, it can only be found in people already infected with HBV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The HBV vaccine will therefore protect against both infections.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Like other hepatitis viruses, HDV is transmitted through contact with infected blood or blood products, semen, or other bodily fluids.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HDV infection of chronically infected HBV-carriers may lead to <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/hepatitis/whocdscsrncs20011/en/index7.html#fulminant">fulminant</a> acute hepatitis, a condition in which the liver produces a severe acute inflammatory response leading to extensive tissue damage and liver failure. It is 10 times more likely that fulminant acute hepatitis will develop in individuals co-infected with HDV and HBV than with other types of hepatitis viruses. It is also more likely for HDV/HDV co-infection to lead to severe chronic active hepatitis, increasing the risk of cirrhosis. Worldwide, more than 10 million people are infected with HDV, with a mortality rate between 2% and 20%, which is ten times higher than for hepatitis B alone.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis E</strong> is caused by Hepatitis E Virus, which infects about 20 million people in the world every year, leading to about 3 million cases of acute hepatitis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is transmitted mainly through contaminated drinking water worldwide, and is more common in East and South Asia.

Nor is it spread through casual contact, such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Infection can happen by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li>sharing contaminated needles, syringes, or other injection drug equipment</li>\r\n	<li>being accidentally pricked by contaminated needlesticks or other sharp instruments (i.e healthcare professionals)</li>\r\n	<li>having received a blood transfusion or organ transplant before the early 1990s in developed countries — when widespread screening for HCV was introduced with increasing levels of efficacy at detecting the virus.

According to US Centers for Disease prevention and Control (CDC), approximately 6% of infants born to infected mothers will get Hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV infection can only be prevented by avoiding blood-to-blood contacts.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventative measures should also include getting tattoes and piercings in certified facilities that use sterile instruments. Healthcare workers should follow professional preventative guidelines.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV cannot usually be transmitted sexually. Nevertheless, even if sexual transmission is very uncommon, practices involving blood contact should be considered <em>at risk</em> behaviors. Having a sexually transmitted disease or HIV, having sex with multiple partners, or engaging in rough sex appears to increase a person’s risk of getting Hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Sharing razors and toothbrushes can expose an individual to infection as well.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Still, about 1 out of 4 patients does not know how or when he or she was infected.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a><sup><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"></a></sup></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">People who have recovered from acute hepatitis C and those who have been cured must be careful about prevention, since reinfection is possible.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is as yet, no proven vaccine for HCV.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">6.<strong><a name="sec6"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Why don’t we have a vaccine for HCV?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A vaccine contains a biological agent that is usually an attenuated or replication-deficient version of a disease causing organism. Exposure to this agent will safely stimulate an individual’s immune system to acquire an immunity to the microorganism without causing disease. HCV is a difficult virus to produce a vaccine for because of its genetic diversity. As such, it is a challenge for scientists to find a target on the virus that is common across HCV genotypes and subgenotypes.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In contrast, HBV is easily recognized by the protein called Antigen Australia (HBsAg), and an immunological response against HbsAg can stop the infection, but researchers have not yet found such a promising target in the structure of HCV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The first vaccine for HCV to reach clinical trials was found to be safe and produced a good immune response in the 15 healthy human volunteers who took part in the phase 1 safety trial. Its efficacy is currently under investigation among intravenous drug users in two sites in the USA. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">7.<strong><a name="sec7"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Can blood transfusions still transmit HCV today?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In developed countries<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a>, the first blood test for HCV was introduced in 1990. This test could detect antibodies against HCV proteins. In the USA, screening blood from donors with this HCV test decreased the risk of transfusion-associated HCV infection per unit of blood from 0.36% (1 in 274) to 0.07% (1 in 3300). Today it is estimated that this test has prevented transmission of HCV to 40,000 patients per year in the US. This test wasn’t perfect. Antibodies to HCV weren’t detectable in the blood for at least 12 weeks after infection, and sometimes more than 26 weeks. During this window, tainted blood could therefore appear safe.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A second-generation more sensitive test, able to detect infected blood as early as 10-20 days post infection, was developed and approved in 1992 . It is estimated that this new test prevented an additional 13,000 people from becoming infected with HCV each year.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/history-of-postransfusion-hep.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2058 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/history-of-postransfusion-hep.jpg" alt="history of postransfusion hep" width="567" height="454" /></a></span>Globally<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a>, blood transfusions are not yet as safe as they are in higher-income countries.

WHO estimates that the lack of effective screening results in up to 5 million new infections of hepatitis C every year in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">8.<strong><a name="sec8"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are the challenges of HCV prevention in lower income countries?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The transmission of hepatitis C persists in most parts of Africa, as well as in other parts of the world, primarily because of traditional habits and a lack of resources in healthcare settings.</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h3Z8DuJnwWM?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> 9.<strong><a name="sec9"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are HCV genotypes, how many strains do we know and how common are they?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There are 7 main genotypes of Hepatitis C . These differences are based on major viral genetic characteristics, i.e. differences in the genetic sequence that may affect functional features of the virus and how it will respond to pharmacological treatments or antiviral drugs like interferon.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Other, more minor, variants can be found within each genotype; HCV is further classified into 67 confirmed and 20 provisional subtypes. The genetic differences between subtypes are more subtle, but these still need to be considered since these can sometimes influence the virus’s response to different kinds of treatments . In genotype 1, for example, the difference between genotype 1a and 1b is relevant in terms of anticipated treatment response and must therefore be assessed before initiating treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The high degree of genetic diversity of HCV continues to pose a significant challenge for achieving successful vaccines and drug therapies that are effective for all genotypes and subtypes, the so-called pan-genotypic treatment. Such an option would be of particularinterest in developing countries, where genotype testing is often unreliable or difficult to perform.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/most-common-genotypes.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2062 alignnone" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/most-common-genotypes-300x188.jpg" alt="most common genotypes" width="450" height="282" /></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some current treatments are said to be pan-genotypic, but in the real world they have different degrees of effectiveness for different genotypes and are not approved for all of them (<em>see</em> treatment module). Doses, length of treatment, and rate of success still partly depend on HCV genotype, and sometimes subtype. Alternative drugs with broader efficacy are currently under investigation.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is possible for a person to be infected with more than one genotype.</p>\r\n<p class="alignleft" style="text-align: justify;">Globally, the most common genotype is G1 (42% of all HCV cases), followed by G3 (26%) and G4 (17%). The most common subtype is 1b (27%).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Global distribution of different genotypes shows different prevalence in different areas of the world.</p>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence-map_genotypes.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2063 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence-map_genotypes.jpg" alt="prevalence map_genotypes" width="950" height="404" /></a><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Map taken from Messina et al, 2014 (Fig 1A)</strong></span>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Genotype 1 (subtype 1b), is the most prevalent genotype in higher income countries, followed by genotype 3.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The global distribution of HCV genetic variation could be related to historical and contemporary trends in human migration. For example, strains from West Africa (genotype 2) could have been brought to the Americas through the trans-Atlantic slave trade.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One possible explanation for the global distribution of genotype 1 is its association with the most common cause of HCV infection in the 20th century — the distribution of contaminated blood and blood products before HCV screening of blood began. In fact, genotype 1 is prevalent in developed countries, where blood transfusions were more available and widespread: a hypothesis is that the most common sources of blood in those years were from areas where this genotype was prevalent.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The global dissemination of genotype 3 is more likely to be attributed to the association of subtype 3a with injection drug use and to population migration in United Kingdom during colonialism from countries where subtype 3a is dominant, such as India and Pakistan.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if genotype 1 and 3 infections are more prevalent than all other genotypes globally. Genotypes found more commonly in lower-income countries still account for a significant proportion of HCV cases worldwide. Specifically, genotype 2 is most frequent in West Africa and parts of South America (the latter likely reflecting population movements resulting from the trans-Atlantic slave trade), while genotypes 4 and 6 are common in Central/North Africa and East/Southeast Asia, respectively.</p>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/be-aware-box_1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2070 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/be-aware-box_1.jpg" alt="be aware box_1" width="1205" height="378" /></a>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">10.<strong><a name="sec10"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are the symptoms of hepatitis C?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Most people with hepatitis C do not have symptoms and do not know they are infected until their liver has sustained significant damage.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A chronic viral hepatitis infection can present without any symptoms for decades.\r\nHowever, it is possible to experience the following symptoms:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>feeling unusually tired all the time</li>\r\n	<li>depression</li>\r\n	<li>jaundice</li>\r\n	<li>a general sense of feeling unwell</li>\r\n	<li>abdominal pain or bloating</li>\r\n	<li>loss of memory</li>\r\n	<li>itchy skin</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Since these symptoms are very vague, and similar to those reported in many other common diseases, people are often unaware of their condition until they develop cirrhosis, when scar tissue replaces healthy tissue in the liver and prevents the liver from working properly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The early stages of cirrhosis can be as insidious as the previous phases, with very few or no symptoms experienced by the individual, but as the liver loses its ability to function properly, a loss of appetite, nausea and itchy skin become more and more common.\r\nAs the disease progresses, and liver functions are affected, many new symptoms tend to develop:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">weight loss and muscle wasting</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">tenderness or pain around the liver area</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">blood capillaries on the skin above waist level</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">a tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequent nosebleeds or bleeding gums</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">hair loss</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">fever and shivering attacks</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">swelling in the legs, ankles and feet due to a build-up of fluid (edema)</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">swelling in abdomen, due to a build-up of fluid known as ascites</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Changes in personality, insomnia, memory loss, confusion and difficulty concentrating are caused by an encephalopathy that can occur when toxins affect the brain, because the liver is unable to remove them from the body.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">11.<a name="sec11"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How often does the disease progress into a chronic infection and what happens to the liver?</span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the WHO, at least 15% of infected persons spontaneously clear the virus within 6 months of infection, without any treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The remaining 55–85% of persons will develop a chronic HCV infection. When chronic Hepatitis C develops, it can result in long-term health problems, including liver damage, liver failure, liver cancer, and even death.\r\nOf those with chronic HCV infection, the risk of cirrhosis of the liver is 15–30% within 20 years.\r\nChronic hepatitis C is the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer and the most common reason for liver transplantation in the United States.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">For every 100 persons infected with HCV, approximately 1–5 will die from the consequences of chronic infection (liver cancer or cirrhosis) (source CDC).</p>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/z_liver-damage_timeline_1-flat-small.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2036 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/z_liver-damage_timeline_1-flat-small.jpg" alt="liver damage_timeline_final" width="2508" height="1751" /></a>\r\n\r\nbased on http://www.hepatitisc.uw.edu/go/evaluation-staging-monitoring/natural-history/core-concept/all\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCyoHQ-KKaw?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> 12.<strong><a name="sec12"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How can Hepatitis C be diagnosed?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In most cases infection is identified when the patient is screened for blood donation or when elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT, a liver enzyme) levels are detected during routine medical exams.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When HCV infection is suspected, a blood test is performed to search for antibodies against HCV. If the test detects the presence of antibodies, a second test is performed to directly establish whether the virus itself is currently present in the individual.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/org-chart_good-one2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2279 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/org-chart_good-one2.jpg" alt="org chart_good one2" width="907" height="2750" /></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">...</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9S1ycVi9gA?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C is based on the detection of both anti-HCV antibodies and direct detection of the HCV virus in the presence of biological (i.e. abnormal levels of liver enzymes in blood tests) or histological (that can be seen examining small parts of liver tissue taken by biopsy) signs of chronic hepatitis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Having anti-HCV antibodies (anti-HCV positive) in blood does not necessarily mean that an individual has an active hepatitis C infection. The presence of antibodies is an indication that a person has at some point in the past mounted an immune response againt HCV. Approximately 20% of the infected people clear the virus within 6 months, and these individuals will continue to carry antibodies againt HCV. Anti-HCV-positive, HCV RNA negative individuals should be retested for HCV RNA three months later to confirm true convalescence. After that, they are not considered to have hepatitis C. Although no longer infected, they will still test positive for anti-HCV antibodies all their lives. Since they don’t host the virus in their blood, they cannot spread the disease.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the presence of both anti-HCV antibodies and the HCV virus in blood indicates the presence of a hepatitis C infection and, consequently, that the person is infectious. If the direct HCV test is negative within 6 months, the patient had acute hepatitis C. If the test continues to yield positive results beyond 6 months, the patient is diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">After that time, it is very rare for the immune system to clear the virus and for the test to be negative.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, HCV antibodies are not protective against reinfection, which can occur after successful treatment as well (See <em>Treatment</em> module for more information).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2283 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2.jpg" alt="Table 2" width="2033" height="556" /></a>A laboratory test for identifying the genotype (and 1a/1b subtype) of the hepatitis C strain and an assessment of liver damage will guide treatment choices.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Establishing the amount of virus present, or the “viral load” can also help predict a treatment’s success.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A test of the patient’s DNA can help determine how effective certain drugs can be against HCV. Variants of a gene involved in the immune response against HCV (Interleukin 28B, IL28B), can alter the effect of certain HCV treatments (See Treatment module).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">13.<span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff;" name="sec13"></a>How can liver damage be assessed?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main factors influencing the type and timing of treatment is the severity of liver disease.\r\nPatients with cirrhosis have to be identified since their treatment regimen needs to be adapted accordingly. The fibrosis stage can be assessed initially with imaging (ultrasound scan, MRI,…), liver stiffness measurement, and identification of biomarkers in the blood.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Liver stiffness measurement (FibroScan®) measures how quickly vibrations pass through the liver. The more ‘stiff’ or damaged the liver is, the more quickly the waves will pass through it .</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Blood biomarkers include several direct markers which correlate with, or are part of, the liver matrix that is produced in the fibrosis process. Other indirect markers reflect changes in liver function. They are molecules released into the blood when there is inflammation of the liver.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Both stiffness measurement and biomarkers can distinguish quite well between cirrhosis and no-fibrosis. Combined, these tests can identify intermediate degrees of fibrosis. These tests reduce the need for an invasive liver biopsy, a procedure that can be problematic for patients with impaired blood clotting capacity.\r\nIn patients without compromised blood clotting, there is little risk of hemorrage from a liver biopsy, since it involves taking a small tissue sample from the liver though the skin by percutaneous core needle, under ultrasound guide. This tissue sample is then examined under a microscope.</p>\r\n14.<strong><a name="sec14"></a> How is Hepatitis C treated and managed?</strong>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When a diagnosis of Hepatitis C is confirmed, the presence or absence of other diseases must be established since this can influence prognosis and treatment. Mycotoxins, as well as alcohol, can make the evolution of the disease more severe. A concurrent infection with HIV, for example, can require a different approach with different drugs, and possible drug interactions must also be considered.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The degree of liver damage and virus genotype are used to drive treatment and management of the disease (see treatment module).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A therapy’s success is evaluated by blood tests showing no detectable virus. A sustained virus response (SVR), is the continued absence of detectable HCV virus in the blood six months (24 weeks) after the end of treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The antiviral Interferon-α was the the first drug treatment for HCV after it was discovered in 1989. In 2011, a more persistent form of interferon-α (Pegylated interferon- α), together with the antiviral drug ribavirin, increased the rates of success. These, however, never exceeded a 50% cure rate, and their heavy side effects often forced patients to discontinue the treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2011, new antivirals called Direct Agent Antivirals (DAA, i.e. protease inhibitors acting directly on the virus instead of on the patient) were introduced, to be given in association with previous drugs (triple therapy regimen). They improved the SVR in up to 75% of patients, but with even worse side effects.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All these therapies were more effective on other genotypes than on genotype 1, the most common in higher income countries. Substantial research efforts led to a new class of DAA. The first to be introduced was sofosbuvir in 2014. The new therapies are even more effective on genotype 1 than on others, approaching 95% of success rates in clinical trials with fewer and milder side effects.\r\nNow, the real challenge is providing access to these revolutionary drugs (please refer to Treatment section for success rates of the DAA in other genotypes). They are very expensive and on a global scale most healthcare systems and patients cannot afford them.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This has made hepatitis C therapy more a policy issue than a medical one.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9S1ycVi9gA?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>REFERENCES</strong>\r\n\r\nPrati, D.

It can be caused by such things as bacteria, viruses, misuse of alcohol or toxins. Liver inflammation or damage can compromise liver function.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Acute Hepatitis </strong>C virus infection is a short-term illness that occurs within the first 6 months after someone is exposed to the Hepatitis C virus. For most people, acute infection leads to chronic infection.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chronic Hepatitis</strong> C virus infection is a long-term illness that occurs when the Hepatitis C virus remains in a person’s body. Hepatitis C virus infection can last a lifetime and lead to serious liver problems, including cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) or liver cancer.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This is because inflammation sustained over an extended period of time leads to liver damage, and repeated attempts to repair the tissue can result in the formation of scars of fibrous tissue.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Liver failure occurs When the liver cannot keep up with the body’s needs anymore, a condition that can be life-threatening and can be cured only by a liver transplant.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">2. <strong><a name="sec2"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Why is the liver so important ?

In this case it is called <strong>Viral Hepatitis</strong>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n4.<strong><a name="sec4"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Which viruses can cause Viral Hepatitis?</span></strong>\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fB52q9fc-As?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe know several viruses that can cause viral hepatitis:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>hepatitis A virus (HAV): Please refer to table 1 for detailed information about HAV</li>\r\n	<li>hepatitis B virus (HBV). Please refer to table 1 for detailed information about HBV</li>\r\n	<li>hepatitis C virus (HCV). Please refer to table 1 for detailed information about HCV</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe most important viruses causing hepatitis are Hepatitis A, B and C.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hepatitis delta virus</strong> (HDV) and <strong>hepatitis E virus</strong> (HEV), are much less common. They are responsible for only 7% of the cases of viral hepatitis in the world.\r\n\r\nIn some rare cases <strong>adenovirus</strong>, <strong>cytomegalovirus</strong> (CMV), <strong>Epstein-Barr virus</strong> (EBV), or <strong>herpes simplex virus</strong> (HSV) can also cause hepatitis.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2041 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-1.jpg" alt="Table 1" width="1894" height="2663" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis D</strong> is caused by Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV). Because HDV needs the hepatitis B virus to replicate and survive in the body, it can only be found in people already infected with HBV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The HBV vaccine will therefore protect against both infections.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Like other hepatitis viruses, HDV is transmitted through contact with infected blood or blood products, semen, or other bodily fluids.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HDV infection of chronically infected HBV-carriers may lead to <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/hepatitis/whocdscsrncs20011/en/index7.html#fulminant">fulminant</a> acute hepatitis, a condition in which the liver produces a severe acute inflammatory response leading to extensive tissue damage and liver failure. It is 10 times more likely that fulminant acute hepatitis will develop in individuals co-infected with HDV and HBV than with other types of hepatitis viruses. It is also more likely for HDV/HDV co-infection to lead to severe chronic active hepatitis, increasing the risk of cirrhosis. Worldwide, more than 10 million people are infected with HDV, with a mortality rate between 2% and 20%, which is ten times higher than for hepatitis B alone.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis E</strong> is caused by Hepatitis E Virus, which infects about 20 million people in the world every year, leading to about 3 million cases of acute hepatitis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is transmitted mainly through contaminated drinking water worldwide, and is more common in East and South Asia. It usually resolves within 4–6 weeks, but in some cases can lead to a fulminant form of hepatitis, responsible for 56,600 deaths in the world every year.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The first vaccine to prevent hepatitis E virus infection has been produced and licensed in China, but is not yet available globally.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">5.<strong><a name="sec5"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How can different viral hepatitis be transmitted and how can transmission be prevented?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis A</strong> is transmitted through <strong>ingestion</strong> of microscopic amounts of fecal material, such as through contaminated food, drink, and objects.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis A transmission happens mainly by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">eating fruits, vegetables, or other foods contaminated during handling</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">eating raw shellfish harvested from contaminated water</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">swallowing contaminated ice.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">These at-risk behaviours should be avoided to prevent transmission, particularly when travelling to countries that have a high or intermediate prevalence of the disease.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vaccination is t</strong>he most effective way to prevent Hepatitis A.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis B</strong> is transmitted by contact with infected blood, semen, or other <strong>body fluids</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis B transmission can therefore happen by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">being born to an infected mother</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">having sexual intercourse with an infected person</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">sharing contaminated needles, syringes, or other injection drug equipment</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">being accidentally pricked by contaminated needlesticks or other sharp instruments (i.e healthcare professionals).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventative measures established for other blood and sexually transmitted diseases, both in healthcare and in everyday life, should be adopted to prevent Hepatitis B transmission.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Like Hepatitis A, the most effective way to prevent Hepatitis B is <strong>vaccination</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis C</strong> is spread through blood-to-blood contact. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water. Nor is it spread through casual contact, such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Infection can happen by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li>sharing contaminated needles, syringes, or other injection drug equipment</li>\r\n	<li>being accidentally pricked by contaminated needlesticks or other sharp instruments (i.e healthcare professionals)</li>\r\n	<li>having received a blood transfusion or organ transplant before the early 1990s in developed countries — when widespread screening for HCV was introduced with increasing levels of efficacy at detecting the virus. In low resource countries, blood safety remains an issue of major concern.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Birth to an infected mother is a less common mode of transmission. According to US Centers for Disease prevention and Control (CDC), approximately 6% of infants born to infected mothers will get Hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV infection can only be prevented by avoiding blood-to-blood contacts.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventative measures should also include getting tattoes and piercings in certified facilities that use sterile instruments. Healthcare workers should follow professional preventative guidelines.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV cannot usually be transmitted sexually. Nevertheless, even if sexual transmission is very uncommon, practices involving blood contact should be considered <em>at risk</em> behaviors. Having a sexually transmitted disease or HIV, having sex with multiple partners, or engaging in rough sex appears to increase a person’s risk of getting Hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Sharing razors and toothbrushes can expose an individual to infection as well.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Still, about 1 out of 4 patients does not know how or when he or she was infected.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a><sup><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"></a></sup></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">People who have recovered from acute hepatitis C and those who have been cured must be careful about prevention, since reinfection is possible.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is as yet, no proven vaccine for HCV.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">6.<strong><a name="sec6"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Why don’t we have a vaccine for HCV?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A vaccine contains a biological agent that is usually an attenuated or replication-deficient version of a disease causing organism. Exposure to this agent will safely stimulate an individual’s immune system to acquire an immunity to the microorganism without causing disease. HCV is a difficult virus to produce a vaccine for because of its genetic diversity. As such, it is a challenge for scientists to find a target on the virus that is common across HCV genotypes and subgenotypes.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In contrast, HBV is easily recognized by the protein called Antigen Australia (HBsAg), and an immunological response against HbsAg can stop the infection, but researchers have not yet found such a promising target in the structure of HCV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The first vaccine for HCV to reach clinical trials was found to be safe and produced a good immune response in the 15 healthy human volunteers who took part in the phase 1 safety trial. Its efficacy is currently under investigation among intravenous drug users in two sites in the USA. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">7.<strong><a name="sec7"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Can blood transfusions still transmit HCV today?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In developed countries<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a>, the first blood test for HCV was introduced in 1990. This test could detect antibodies against HCV proteins. In the USA, screening blood from donors with this HCV test decreased the risk of transfusion-associated HCV infection per unit of blood from 0.36% (1 in 274) to 0.07% (1 in 3300). Today it is estimated that this test has prevented transmission of HCV to 40,000 patients per year in the US. This test wasn’t perfect. Antibodies to HCV weren’t detectable in the blood for at least 12 weeks after infection, and sometimes more than 26 weeks. During this window, tainted blood could therefore appear safe.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A second-generation more sensitive test, able to detect infected blood as early as 10-20 days post infection, was developed and approved in 1992 . It is estimated that this new test prevented an additional 13,000 people from becoming infected with HCV each year.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/history-of-postransfusion-hep.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2058 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/history-of-postransfusion-hep.jpg" alt="history of postransfusion hep" width="567" height="454" /></a></span>Globally<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a>, blood transfusions are not yet as safe as they are in higher-income countries. Of 148 countries that provided WHO data for screening, 41 reported that they lacked the resources to screen all donated blood for one or more of the required transfusion-transmitted diseases (HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In sub-Saharan Africa, 28 out of the 40 countries have yet to implement national quality systems needed to assure effective screening of donated blood. WHO estimates that the lack of effective screening results in up to 5 million new infections of hepatitis C every year in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">8.<strong><a name="sec8"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are the challenges of HCV prevention in lower income countries?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The transmission of hepatitis C persists in most parts of Africa, as well as in other parts of the world, primarily because of traditional habits and a lack of resources in healthcare settings.</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h3Z8DuJnwWM?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> 9.<strong><a name="sec9"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are HCV genotypes, how many strains do we know and how common are they?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There are 7 main genotypes of Hepatitis C . These differences are based on major viral genetic characteristics, i.e. differences in the genetic sequence that may affect functional features of the virus and how it will respond to pharmacological treatments or antiviral drugs like interferon.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Other, more minor, variants can be found within each genotype; HCV is further classified into 67 confirmed and 20 provisional subtypes. The genetic differences between subtypes are more subtle, but these still need to be considered since these can sometimes influence the virus’s response to different kinds of treatments . In genotype 1, for example, the difference between genotype 1a and 1b is relevant in terms of anticipated treatment response and must therefore be assessed before initiating treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The high degree of genetic diversity of HCV continues to pose a significant challenge for achieving successful vaccines and drug therapies that are effective for all genotypes and subtypes, the so-called pan-genotypic treatment. Such an option would be of particularinterest in developing countries, where genotype testing is often unreliable or difficult to perform.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/most-common-genotypes.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2062 alignnone" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/most-common-genotypes-300x188.jpg" alt="most common genotypes" width="450" height="282" /></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some current treatments are said to be pan-genotypic, but in the real world they have different degrees of effectiveness for different genotypes and are not approved for all of them (<em>see</em> treatment module). Doses, length of treatment, and rate of success still partly depend on HCV genotype, and sometimes subtype. Alternative drugs with broader efficacy are currently under investigation.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is possible for a person to be infected with more than one genotype.</p>\r\n<p class="alignleft" style="text-align: justify;">Globally, the most common genotype is G1 (42% of all HCV cases), followed by G3 (26%) and G4 (17%). The most common subtype is 1b (27%).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Global distribution of different genotypes shows different prevalence in different areas of the world.</p>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence-map_genotypes.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2063 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence-map_genotypes.jpg" alt="prevalence map_genotypes" width="950" height="404" /></a><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Map taken from Messina et al, 2014 (Fig 1A)</strong></span>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Genotype 1 (subtype 1b), is the most prevalent genotype in higher income countries, followed by genotype 3.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The global distribution of HCV genetic variation could be related to historical and contemporary trends in human migration. For example, strains from West Africa (genotype 2) could have been brought to the Americas through the trans-Atlantic slave trade.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One possible explanation for the global distribution of genotype 1 is its association with the most common cause of HCV infection in the 20th century — the distribution of contaminated blood and blood products before HCV screening of blood began. In fact, genotype 1 is prevalent in developed countries, where blood transfusions were more available and widespread: a hypothesis is that the most common sources of blood in those years were from areas where this genotype was prevalent.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The global dissemination of genotype 3 is more likely to be attributed to the association of subtype 3a with injection drug use and to population migration in United Kingdom during colonialism from countries where subtype 3a is dominant, such as India and Pakistan.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if genotype 1 and 3 infections are more prevalent than all other genotypes globally. Genotypes found more commonly in lower-income countries still account for a significant proportion of HCV cases worldwide. Specifically, genotype 2 is most frequent in West Africa and parts of South America (the latter likely reflecting population movements resulting from the trans-Atlantic slave trade), while genotypes 4 and 6 are common in Central/North Africa and East/Southeast Asia, respectively.</p>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/be-aware-box_1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2070 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/be-aware-box_1.jpg" alt="be aware box_1" width="1205" height="378" /></a>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">10.<strong><a name="sec10"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are the symptoms of hepatitis C?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Most people with hepatitis C do not have symptoms and do not know they are infected until their liver has sustained significant damage.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A chronic viral hepatitis infection can present without any symptoms for decades.\r\nHowever, it is possible to experience the following symptoms:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>feeling unusually tired all the time</li>\r\n	<li>depression</li>\r\n	<li>jaundice</li>\r\n	<li>a general sense of feeling unwell</li>\r\n	<li>abdominal pain or bloating</li>\r\n	<li>loss of memory</li>\r\n	<li>itchy skin</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Since these symptoms are very vague, and similar to those reported in many other common diseases, people are often unaware of their condition until they develop cirrhosis, when scar tissue replaces healthy tissue in the liver and prevents the liver from working properly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The early stages of cirrhosis can be as insidious as the previous phases, with very few or no symptoms experienced by the individual, but as the liver loses its ability to function properly, a loss of appetite, nausea and itchy skin become more and more common.\r\nAs the disease progresses, and liver functions are affected, many new symptoms tend to develop:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">weight loss and muscle wasting</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">tenderness or pain around the liver area</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">blood capillaries on the skin above waist level</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">a tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequent nosebleeds or bleeding gums</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">hair loss</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">fever and shivering attacks</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">swelling in the legs, ankles and feet due to a build-up of fluid (edema)</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">swelling in abdomen, due to a build-up of fluid known as ascites</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Changes in personality, insomnia, memory loss, confusion and difficulty concentrating are caused by an encephalopathy that can occur when toxins affect the brain, because the liver is unable to remove them from the body.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">11.<strong><a name="sec11"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How often does the disease progress into a chronic infection and what happens to the liver?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the WHO, at least 15% of infected persons spontaneously clear the virus within 6 months of infection, without any treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The remaining 55–85% of persons will develop a chronic HCV infection. When chronic Hepatitis C develops, it can result in long-term health problems, including liver damage, liver failure, liver cancer, and even death.\r\nOf those with chronic HCV infection, the risk of cirrhosis of the liver is 15–30% within 20 years.\r\nChronic hepatitis C is the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer and the most common reason for liver transplantation in the United States.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">For every 100 persons infected with HCV, approximately 1–5 will die from the consequences of chronic infection (liver cancer or cirrhosis) (source CDC).</p>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/z_liver-damage_timeline_1-flat-small.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2036 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/z_liver-damage_timeline_1-flat-small.jpg" alt="liver damage_timeline_final" width="2508" height="1751" /></a>\r\n\r\nbased on http://www.hepatitisc.uw.edu/go/evaluation-staging-monitoring/natural-history/core-concept/all\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCyoHQ-KKaw?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> 12.<strong><a name="sec12"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How can Hepatitis C be diagnosed?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In most cases infection is identified when the patient is screened for blood donation or when elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT, a liver enzyme) levels are detected during routine medical exams.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When HCV infection is suspected, a blood test is performed to search for antibodies against HCV. If the test detects the presence of antibodies, a second test is performed to directly establish whether the virus itself is currently present in the individual.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/org-chart_good-one2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2279 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/org-chart_good-one2.jpg" alt="org chart_good one2" width="907" height="2750" /></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">...</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9S1ycVi9gA?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C is based on the detection of both anti-HCV antibodies and direct detection of the HCV virus in the presence of biological (i.e. abnormal levels of liver enzymes in blood tests) or histological (that can be seen examining small parts of liver tissue taken by biopsy) signs of chronic hepatitis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Having anti-HCV antibodies (anti-HCV positive) in blood does not necessarily mean that an individual has an active hepatitis C infection. The presence of antibodies is an indication that a person has at some point in the past mounted an immune response againt HCV. Approximately 20% of the infected people clear the virus within 6 months, and these individuals will continue to carry antibodies againt HCV. Anti-HCV-positive, HCV RNA negative individuals should be retested for HCV RNA three months later to confirm true convalescence. After that, they are not considered to have hepatitis C. Although no longer infected, they will still test positive for anti-HCV antibodies all their lives. Since they don’t host the virus in their blood, they cannot spread the disease.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the presence of both anti-HCV antibodies and the HCV virus in blood indicates the presence of a hepatitis C infection and, consequently, that the person is infectious. If the direct HCV test is negative within 6 months, the patient had acute hepatitis C. If the test continues to yield positive results beyond 6 months, the patient is diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">After that time, it is very rare for the immune system to clear the virus and for the test to be negative.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, HCV antibodies are not protective against reinfection, which can occur after successful treatment as well (See <em>Treatment</em> module for more information).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2283 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2.jpg" alt="Table 2" width="2033" height="556" /></a>A laboratory test for identifying the genotype (and 1a/1b subtype) of the hepatitis C strain and an assessment of liver damage will guide treatment choices.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Establishing the amount of virus present, or the “viral load” can also help predict a treatment’s success.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A test of the patient’s DNA can help determine how effective certain drugs can be against HCV. Variants of a gene involved in the immune response against HCV (Interleukin 28B, IL28B), can alter the effect of certain HCV treatments (See Treatment module).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">13.<span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff;" name="sec13"></a>How can liver damage be assessed?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main factors influencing the type and timing of treatment is the severity of liver disease.\r\nPatients with cirrhosis have to be identified since their treatment regimen needs to be adapted accordingly. The fibrosis stage can be assessed initially with imaging (ultrasound scan, MRI,…), liver stiffness measurement, and identification of biomarkers in the blood.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Liver stiffness measurement (FibroScan®) measures how quickly vibrations pass through the liver. The more ‘stiff’ or damaged the liver is, the more quickly the waves will pass through it .</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Blood biomarkers include several direct markers which correlate with, or are part of, the liver matrix that is produced in the fibrosis process. Other indirect markers reflect changes in liver function. They are molecules released into the blood when there is inflammation of the liver.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Both stiffness measurement and biomarkers can distinguish quite well between cirrhosis and no-fibrosis. Combined, these tests can identify intermediate degrees of fibrosis. These tests reduce the need for an invasive liver biopsy, a procedure that can be problematic for patients with impaired blood clotting capacity.\r\nIn patients without compromised blood clotting, there is little risk of hemorrage from a liver biopsy, since it involves taking a small tissue sample from the liver though the skin by percutaneous core needle, under ultrasound guide. This tissue sample is then examined under a microscope.</p>\r\n14.<strong><a name="sec14"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How is Hepatitis C treated and managed?</span></strong>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When a diagnosis of Hepatitis C is confirmed, the presence or absence of other diseases must be established since this can influence prognosis and treatment. Mycotoxins, as well as alcohol, can make the evolution of the disease more severe. A concurrent infection with HIV, for example, can require a different approach with different drugs, and possible drug interactions must also be considered.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The degree of liver damage and virus genotype are used to drive treatment and management of the disease (see treatment module).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A therapy’s success is evaluated by blood tests showing no detectable virus. A sustained virus response (SVR), is the continued absence of detectable HCV virus in the blood six months (24 weeks) after the end of treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The antiviral Interferon-α was the the first drug treatment for HCV after it was discovered in 1989. In 2011, a more persistent form of interferon-α (Pegylated interferon- α), together with the antiviral drug ribavirin, increased the rates of success. These, however, never exceeded a 50% cure rate, and their heavy side effects often forced patients to discontinue the treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2011, new antivirals called Direct Agent Antivirals (DAA, i.e. protease inhibitors acting directly on the virus instead of on the patient) were introduced, to be given in association with previous drugs (triple therapy regimen). They improved the SVR in up to 75% of patients, but with even worse side effects.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All these therapies were more effective on other genotypes than on genotype 1, the most common in higher income countries. Substantial research efforts led to a new class of DAA. The first to be introduced was sofosbuvir in 2014. The new therapies are even more effective on genotype 1 than on others, approaching 95% of success rates in clinical trials with fewer and milder side effects.\r\nNow, the real challenge is providing access to these revolutionary drugs (please refer to Treatment section for success rates of the DAA in other genotypes). They are very expensive and on a global scale most healthcare systems and patients cannot afford them.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This has made hepatitis C therapy more a policy issue than a medical one.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9S1ycVi9gA?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>REFERENCES</strong>\r\n\r\nPrati, D.

Liver inflammation or damage can compromise liver function.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Acute Hepatitis </strong>C virus infection is a short-term illness that occurs within the first 6 months after someone is exposed to the Hepatitis C virus. For most people, acute infection leads to chronic infection.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chronic Hepatitis</strong> C virus infection is a long-term illness that occurs when the Hepatitis C virus remains in a person’s body. Hepatitis C virus infection can last a lifetime and lead to serious liver problems, including cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) or liver cancer.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This is because inflammation sustained over an extended period of time leads to liver damage, and repeated attempts to repair the tissue can result in the formation of scars of fibrous tissue.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Liver failure occurs When the liver cannot keep up with the body’s needs anymore, a condition that can be life-threatening and can be cured only by a liver transplant.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">2. <strong><a name="sec2"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Why is the liver so important ?

Because HDV needs the hepatitis B virus to replicate and survive in the body, it can only be found in people already infected with HBV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The HBV vaccine will therefore protect against both infections.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Like other hepatitis viruses, HDV is transmitted through contact with infected blood or blood products, semen, or other bodily fluids.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HDV infection of chronically infected HBV-carriers may lead to <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/hepatitis/whocdscsrncs20011/en/index7.html#fulminant">fulminant</a> acute hepatitis, a condition in which the liver produces a severe acute inflammatory response leading to extensive tissue damage and liver failure. It is 10 times more likely that fulminant acute hepatitis will develop in individuals co-infected with HDV and HBV than with other types of hepatitis viruses. It is also more likely for HDV/HDV co-infection to lead to severe chronic active hepatitis, increasing the risk of cirrhosis. Worldwide, more than 10 million people are infected with HDV, with a mortality rate between 2% and 20%, which is ten times higher than for hepatitis B alone.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis E</strong> is caused by Hepatitis E Virus, which infects about 20 million people in the world every year, leading to about 3 million cases of acute hepatitis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is transmitted mainly through contaminated drinking water worldwide, and is more common in East and South Asia. It usually resolves within 4–6 weeks, but in some cases can lead to a fulminant form of hepatitis, responsible for 56,600 deaths in the world every year.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The first vaccine to prevent hepatitis E virus infection has been produced and licensed in China, but is not yet available globally.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">5.<strong><a name="sec5"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How can different viral hepatitis be transmitted and how can transmission be prevented?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis A</strong> is transmitted through <strong>ingestion</strong> of microscopic amounts of fecal material, such as through contaminated food, drink, and objects.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis A transmission happens mainly by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">eating fruits, vegetables, or other foods contaminated during handling</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">eating raw shellfish harvested from contaminated water</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">swallowing contaminated ice.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">These at-risk behaviours should be avoided to prevent transmission, particularly when travelling to countries that have a high or intermediate prevalence of the disease.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vaccination is t</strong>he most effective way to prevent Hepatitis A.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis B</strong> is transmitted by contact with infected blood, semen, or other <strong>body fluids</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis B transmission can therefore happen by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">being born to an infected mother</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">having sexual intercourse with an infected person</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">sharing contaminated needles, syringes, or other injection drug equipment</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">being accidentally pricked by contaminated needlesticks or other sharp instruments (i.e healthcare professionals).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventative measures established for other blood and sexually transmitted diseases, both in healthcare and in everyday life, should be adopted to prevent Hepatitis B transmission.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Like Hepatitis A, the most effective way to prevent Hepatitis B is <strong>vaccination</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis C</strong> is spread through blood-to-blood contact.

In low resource countries, blood safety remains an issue of major concern.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Birth to an infected mother is a less common mode of transmission. According to US Centers for Disease prevention and Control (CDC), approximately 6% of infants born to infected mothers will get Hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV infection can only be prevented by avoiding blood-to-blood contacts.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventative measures should also include getting tattoes and piercings in certified facilities that use sterile instruments. Healthcare workers should follow professional preventative guidelines.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV cannot usually be transmitted sexually. Nevertheless, even if sexual transmission is very uncommon, practices involving blood contact should be considered <em>at risk</em> behaviors. Having a sexually transmitted disease or HIV, having sex with multiple partners, or engaging in rough sex appears to increase a person’s risk of getting Hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Sharing razors and toothbrushes can expose an individual to infection as well.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Still, about 1 out of 4 patients does not know how or when he or she was infected.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a><sup><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"></a></sup></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">People who have recovered from acute hepatitis C and those who have been cured must be careful about prevention, since reinfection is possible.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is as yet, no proven vaccine for HCV.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">6.<strong><a name="sec6"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Why don’t we have a vaccine for HCV?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A vaccine contains a biological agent that is usually an attenuated or replication-deficient version of a disease causing organism. Exposure to this agent will safely stimulate an individual’s immune system to acquire an immunity to the microorganism without causing disease. HCV is a difficult virus to produce a vaccine for because of its genetic diversity. As such, it is a challenge for scientists to find a target on the virus that is common across HCV genotypes and subgenotypes.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In contrast, HBV is easily recognized by the protein called Antigen Australia (HBsAg), and an immunological response against HbsAg can stop the infection, but researchers have not yet found such a promising target in the structure of HCV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The first vaccine for HCV to reach clinical trials was found to be safe and produced a good immune response in the 15 healthy human volunteers who took part in the phase 1 safety trial. Its efficacy is currently under investigation among intravenous drug users in two sites in the USA. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">7.<strong><a name="sec7"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Can blood transfusions still transmit HCV today?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In developed countries<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a>, the first blood test for HCV was introduced in 1990. This test could detect antibodies against HCV proteins. In the USA, screening blood from donors with this HCV test decreased the risk of transfusion-associated HCV infection per unit of blood from 0.36% (1 in 274) to 0.07% (1 in 3300). Today it is estimated that this test has prevented transmission of HCV to 40,000 patients per year in the US. This test wasn’t perfect. Antibodies to HCV weren’t detectable in the blood for at least 12 weeks after infection, and sometimes more than 26 weeks. During this window, tainted blood could therefore appear safe.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A second-generation more sensitive test, able to detect infected blood as early as 10-20 days post infection, was developed and approved in 1992 . It is estimated that this new test prevented an additional 13,000 people from becoming infected with HCV each year.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/history-of-postransfusion-hep.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2058 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/history-of-postransfusion-hep.jpg" alt="history of postransfusion hep" width="567" height="454" /></a></span>Globally<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a>, blood transfusions are not yet as safe as they are in higher-income countries. Of 148 countries that provided WHO data for screening, 41 reported that they lacked the resources to screen all donated blood for one or more of the required transfusion-transmitted diseases (HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In sub-Saharan Africa, 28 out of the 40 countries have yet to implement national quality systems needed to assure effective screening of donated blood. WHO estimates that the lack of effective screening results in up to 5 million new infections of hepatitis C every year in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">8.<strong><a name="sec8"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are the challenges of HCV prevention in lower income countries?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The transmission of hepatitis C persists in most parts of Africa, as well as in other parts of the world, primarily because of traditional habits and a lack of resources in healthcare settings.</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h3Z8DuJnwWM?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> 9.<strong><a name="sec9"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are HCV genotypes, how many strains do we know and how common are they?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There are 7 main genotypes of Hepatitis C . These differences are based on major viral genetic characteristics, i.e. differences in the genetic sequence that may affect functional features of the virus and how it will respond to pharmacological treatments or antiviral drugs like interferon.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Other, more minor, variants can be found within each genotype; HCV is further classified into 67 confirmed and 20 provisional subtypes. The genetic differences between subtypes are more subtle, but these still need to be considered since these can sometimes influence the virus’s response to different kinds of treatments . In genotype 1, for example, the difference between genotype 1a and 1b is relevant in terms of anticipated treatment response and must therefore be assessed before initiating treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The high degree of genetic diversity of HCV continues to pose a significant challenge for achieving successful vaccines and drug therapies that are effective for all genotypes and subtypes, the so-called pan-genotypic treatment. Such an option would be of particularinterest in developing countries, where genotype testing is often unreliable or difficult to perform.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/most-common-genotypes.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2062 alignnone" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/most-common-genotypes-300x188.jpg" alt="most common genotypes" width="450" height="282" /></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some current treatments are said to be pan-genotypic, but in the real world they have different degrees of effectiveness for different genotypes and are not approved for all of them (<em>see</em> treatment module). Doses, length of treatment, and rate of success still partly depend on HCV genotype, and sometimes subtype. Alternative drugs with broader efficacy are currently under investigation.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is possible for a person to be infected with more than one genotype.</p>\r\n<p class="alignleft" style="text-align: justify;">Globally, the most common genotype is G1 (42% of all HCV cases), followed by G3 (26%) and G4 (17%). The most common subtype is 1b (27%).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Global distribution of different genotypes shows different prevalence in different areas of the world.</p>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence-map_genotypes.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2063 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence-map_genotypes.jpg" alt="prevalence map_genotypes" width="950" height="404" /></a><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Map taken from Messina et al, 2014 (Fig 1A)</strong></span>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Genotype 1 (subtype 1b), is the most prevalent genotype in higher income countries, followed by genotype 3.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The global distribution of HCV genetic variation could be related to historical and contemporary trends in human migration. For example, strains from West Africa (genotype 2) could have been brought to the Americas through the trans-Atlantic slave trade.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One possible explanation for the global distribution of genotype 1 is its association with the most common cause of HCV infection in the 20th century — the distribution of contaminated blood and blood products before HCV screening of blood began. In fact, genotype 1 is prevalent in developed countries, where blood transfusions were more available and widespread: a hypothesis is that the most common sources of blood in those years were from areas where this genotype was prevalent.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The global dissemination of genotype 3 is more likely to be attributed to the association of subtype 3a with injection drug use and to population migration in United Kingdom during colonialism from countries where subtype 3a is dominant, such as India and Pakistan.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if genotype 1 and 3 infections are more prevalent than all other genotypes globally. Genotypes found more commonly in lower-income countries still account for a significant proportion of HCV cases worldwide. Specifically, genotype 2 is most frequent in West Africa and parts of South America (the latter likely reflecting population movements resulting from the trans-Atlantic slave trade), while genotypes 4 and 6 are common in Central/North Africa and East/Southeast Asia, respectively.</p>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/be-aware-box_1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2070 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/be-aware-box_1.jpg" alt="be aware box_1" width="1205" height="378" /></a>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">10.<strong><a name="sec10"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are the symptoms of hepatitis C?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Most people with hepatitis C do not have symptoms and do not know they are infected until their liver has sustained significant damage.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A chronic viral hepatitis infection can present without any symptoms for decades.\r\nHowever, it is possible to experience the following symptoms:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>feeling unusually tired all the time</li>\r\n	<li>depression</li>\r\n	<li>jaundice</li>\r\n	<li>a general sense of feeling unwell</li>\r\n	<li>abdominal pain or bloating</li>\r\n	<li>loss of memory</li>\r\n	<li>itchy skin</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Since these symptoms are very vague, and similar to those reported in many other common diseases, people are often unaware of their condition until they develop cirrhosis, when scar tissue replaces healthy tissue in the liver and prevents the liver from working properly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The early stages of cirrhosis can be as insidious as the previous phases, with very few or no symptoms experienced by the individual, but as the liver loses its ability to function properly, a loss of appetite, nausea and itchy skin become more and more common.\r\nAs the disease progresses, and liver functions are affected, many new symptoms tend to develop:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">weight loss and muscle wasting</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">tenderness or pain around the liver area</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">blood capillaries on the skin above waist level</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">a tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequent nosebleeds or bleeding gums</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">hair loss</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">fever and shivering attacks</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">swelling in the legs, ankles and feet due to a build-up of fluid (edema)</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">swelling in abdomen, due to a build-up of fluid known as ascites</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Changes in personality, insomnia, memory loss, confusion and difficulty concentrating are caused by an encephalopathy that can occur when toxins affect the brain, because the liver is unable to remove them from the body.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">11.<strong><a name="sec11"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How often does the disease progress into a chronic infection and what happens to the liver?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the WHO, at least 15% of infected persons spontaneously clear the virus within 6 months of infection, without any treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The remaining 55–85% of persons will develop a chronic HCV infection. When chronic Hepatitis C develops, it can result in long-term health problems, including liver damage, liver failure, liver cancer, and even death.\r\nOf those with chronic HCV infection, the risk of cirrhosis of the liver is 15–30% within 20 years.\r\nChronic hepatitis C is the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer and the most common reason for liver transplantation in the United States.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">For every 100 persons infected with HCV, approximately 1–5 will die from the consequences of chronic infection (liver cancer or cirrhosis) (source CDC).</p>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/z_liver-damage_timeline_1-flat-small.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2036 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/z_liver-damage_timeline_1-flat-small.jpg" alt="liver damage_timeline_final" width="2508" height="1751" /></a>\r\n\r\nbased on http://www.hepatitisc.uw.edu/go/evaluation-staging-monitoring/natural-history/core-concept/all\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCyoHQ-KKaw?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> 12.<strong><a name="sec12"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How can Hepatitis C be diagnosed?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In most cases infection is identified when the patient is screened for blood donation or when elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT, a liver enzyme) levels are detected during routine medical exams.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When HCV infection is suspected, a blood test is performed to search for antibodies against HCV. If the test detects the presence of antibodies, a second test is performed to directly establish whether the virus itself is currently present in the individual.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/org-chart_good-one2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2279 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/org-chart_good-one2.jpg" alt="org chart_good one2" width="907" height="2750" /></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">...</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9S1ycVi9gA?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C is based on the detection of both anti-HCV antibodies and direct detection of the HCV virus in the presence of biological (i.e. abnormal levels of liver enzymes in blood tests) or histological (that can be seen examining small parts of liver tissue taken by biopsy) signs of chronic hepatitis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Having anti-HCV antibodies (anti-HCV positive) in blood does not necessarily mean that an individual has an active hepatitis C infection. The presence of antibodies is an indication that a person has at some point in the past mounted an immune response againt HCV. Approximately 20% of the infected people clear the virus within 6 months, and these individuals will continue to carry antibodies againt HCV. Anti-HCV-positive, HCV RNA negative individuals should be retested for HCV RNA three months later to confirm true convalescence. After that, they are not considered to have hepatitis C. Although no longer infected, they will still test positive for anti-HCV antibodies all their lives. Since they don’t host the virus in their blood, they cannot spread the disease.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the presence of both anti-HCV antibodies and the HCV virus in blood indicates the presence of a hepatitis C infection and, consequently, that the person is infectious. If the direct HCV test is negative within 6 months, the patient had acute hepatitis C. If the test continues to yield positive results beyond 6 months, the patient is diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">After that time, it is very rare for the immune system to clear the virus and for the test to be negative.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, HCV antibodies are not protective against reinfection, which can occur after successful treatment as well (See <em>Treatment</em> module for more information).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2283 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2.jpg" alt="Table 2" width="2033" height="556" /></a>A laboratory test for identifying the genotype (and 1a/1b subtype) of the hepatitis C strain and an assessment of liver damage will guide treatment choices.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Establishing the amount of virus present, or the “viral load” can also help predict a treatment’s success.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A test of the patient’s DNA can help determine how effective certain drugs can be against HCV. Variants of a gene involved in the immune response against HCV (Interleukin 28B, IL28B), can alter the effect of certain HCV treatments (See Treatment module).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">13.<span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff;" name="sec13"></a>How can liver damage be assessed?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main factors influencing the type and timing of treatment is the severity of liver disease.\r\nPatients with cirrhosis have to be identified since their treatment regimen needs to be adapted accordingly. The fibrosis stage can be assessed initially with imaging (ultrasound scan, MRI,…), liver stiffness measurement, and identification of biomarkers in the blood.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Liver stiffness measurement (FibroScan®) measures how quickly vibrations pass through the liver. The more ‘stiff’ or damaged the liver is, the more quickly the waves will pass through it .</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Blood biomarkers include several direct markers which correlate with, or are part of, the liver matrix that is produced in the fibrosis process. Other indirect markers reflect changes in liver function. They are molecules released into the blood when there is inflammation of the liver.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Both stiffness measurement and biomarkers can distinguish quite well between cirrhosis and no-fibrosis. Combined, these tests can identify intermediate degrees of fibrosis. These tests reduce the need for an invasive liver biopsy, a procedure that can be problematic for patients with impaired blood clotting capacity.\r\nIn patients without compromised blood clotting, there is little risk of hemorrage from a liver biopsy, since it involves taking a small tissue sample from the liver though the skin by percutaneous core needle, under ultrasound guide. This tissue sample is then examined under a microscope.</p>\r\n14.<strong><a name="sec14"></a> <span style="color: #3366ff;">How is Hepatitis C treated and managed?</span></strong>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When a diagnosis of Hepatitis C is confirmed, the presence or absence of other diseases must be established since this can influence prognosis and treatment. Mycotoxins, as well as alcohol, can make the evolution of the disease more severe. A concurrent infection with HIV, for example, can require a different approach with different drugs, and possible drug interactions must also be considered.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The degree of liver damage and virus genotype are used to drive treatment and management of the disease (see treatment module).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A therapy’s success is evaluated by blood tests showing no detectable virus. A sustained virus response (SVR), is the continued absence of detectable HCV virus in the blood six months (24 weeks) after the end of treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The antiviral Interferon-α was the the first drug treatment for HCV after it was discovered in 1989. In 2011, a more persistent form of interferon-α (Pegylated interferon- α), together with the antiviral drug ribavirin, increased the rates of success. These, however, never exceeded a 50% cure rate, and their heavy side effects often forced patients to discontinue the treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2011, new antivirals called Direct Agent Antivirals (DAA, i.e. protease inhibitors acting directly on the virus instead of on the patient) were introduced, to be given in association with previous drugs (triple therapy regimen). They improved the SVR in up to 75% of patients, but with even worse side effects.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All these therapies were more effective on other genotypes than on genotype 1, the most common in higher income countries. Substantial research efforts led to a new class of DAA. The first to be introduced was sofosbuvir in 2014. The new therapies are even more effective on genotype 1 than on others, approaching 95% of success rates in clinical trials with fewer and milder side effects.\r\nNow, the real challenge is providing access to these revolutionary drugs (please refer to Treatment section for success rates of the DAA in other genotypes). They are very expensive and on a global scale most healthcare systems and patients cannot afford them.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This has made hepatitis C therapy more a policy issue than a medical one.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9S1ycVi9gA?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>REFERENCES</strong>\r\n\r\nPrati, D.

It can be caused by such things as bacteria, viruses, misuse of alcohol or toxins. Liver inflammation or damage can compromise liver function.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Acute Hepatitis </strong>C virus infection is a short-term illness that occurs within the first 6 months after someone is exposed to the Hepatitis C virus. For most people, acute infection leads to chronic infection.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chronic Hepatitis</strong> C virus infection is a long-term illness that occurs when the Hepatitis C virus remains in a person’s body. Hepatitis C virus infection can last a lifetime and lead to serious liver problems, including cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) or liver cancer.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This is because inflammation sustained over an extended period of time leads to liver damage, and repeated attempts to repair the tissue can result in the formation of scars of fibrous tissue.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Liver failure occurs When the liver cannot keep up with the body’s needs anymore, a condition that can be life-threatening and can be cured only by a liver transplant.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">2. <strong><a name="sec2"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Why is the liver so important ?

In this case it is called <strong>Viral Hepatitis</strong>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n4.<strong><a name="sec4"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Which viruses can cause Viral Hepatitis?</span></strong>\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fB52q9fc-As?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe know several viruses that can cause viral hepatitis:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>hepatitis A virus (HAV): Please refer to table 1 for detailed information about HAV</li>\r\n	<li>hepatitis B virus (HBV). Please refer to table 1 for detailed information about HBV</li>\r\n	<li>hepatitis C virus (HCV). Please refer to table 1 for detailed information about HCV</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe most important viruses causing hepatitis are Hepatitis A, B and C.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hepatitis delta virus</strong> (HDV) and <strong>hepatitis E virus</strong> (HEV), are much less common. They are responsible for only 7% of the cases of viral hepatitis in the world.\r\n\r\nIn some rare cases <strong>adenovirus</strong>, <strong>cytomegalovirus</strong> (CMV), <strong>Epstein-Barr virus</strong> (EBV), or <strong>herpes simplex virus</strong> (HSV) can also cause hepatitis.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2041 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-1.jpg" alt="Table 1" width="1894" height="2663" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis D</strong> is caused by Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV). Because HDV needs the hepatitis B virus to replicate and survive in the body, it can only be found in people already infected with HBV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The HBV vaccine will therefore protect against both infections.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Like other hepatitis viruses, HDV is transmitted through contact with infected blood or blood products, semen, or other bodily fluids.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HDV infection of chronically infected HBV-carriers may lead to <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/hepatitis/whocdscsrncs20011/en/index7.html#fulminant">fulminant</a> acute hepatitis, a condition in which the liver produces a severe acute inflammatory response leading to extensive tissue damage and liver failure. It is 10 times more likely that fulminant acute hepatitis will develop in individuals co-infected with HDV and HBV than with other types of hepatitis viruses. It is also more likely for HDV/HDV co-infection to lead to severe chronic active hepatitis, increasing the risk of cirrhosis. Worldwide, more than 10 million people are infected with HDV, with a mortality rate between 2% and 20%, which is ten times higher than for hepatitis B alone.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis E</strong> is caused by Hepatitis E Virus, which infects about 20 million people in the world every year, leading to about 3 million cases of acute hepatitis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is transmitted mainly through contaminated drinking water worldwide, and is more common in East and South Asia. It usually resolves within 4–6 weeks, but in some cases can lead to a fulminant form of hepatitis, responsible for 56,600 deaths in the world every year.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The first vaccine to prevent hepatitis E virus infection has been produced and licensed in China, but is not yet available globally.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">5.<strong><a name="sec5"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How can different viral hepatitis be transmitted and how can transmission be prevented?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis A</strong> is transmitted through <strong>ingestion</strong> of microscopic amounts of fecal material, such as through contaminated food, drink, and objects.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis A transmission happens mainly by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">eating fruits, vegetables, or other foods contaminated during handling</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">eating raw shellfish harvested from contaminated water</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">swallowing contaminated ice.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">These at-risk behaviours should be avoided to prevent transmission, particularly when travelling to countries that have a high or intermediate prevalence of the disease.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vaccination is t</strong>he most effective way to prevent Hepatitis A.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis B</strong> is transmitted by contact with infected blood, semen, or other <strong>body fluids</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hepatitis B transmission can therefore happen by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">being born to an infected mother</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">having sexual intercourse with an infected person</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">sharing contaminated needles, syringes, or other injection drug equipment</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">being accidentally pricked by contaminated needlesticks or other sharp instruments (i.e healthcare professionals).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventative measures established for other blood and sexually transmitted diseases, both in healthcare and in everyday life, should be adopted to prevent Hepatitis B transmission.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Like Hepatitis A, the most effective way to prevent Hepatitis B is <strong>vaccination</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hepatitis C</strong> is spread through blood-to-blood contact. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water. Nor is it spread through casual contact, such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Infection can happen by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n	<li>sharing contaminated needles, syringes, or other injection drug equipment</li>\r\n	<li>being accidentally pricked by contaminated needlesticks or other sharp instruments (i.e healthcare professionals)</li>\r\n	<li>having received a blood transfusion or organ transplant before the early 1990s in developed countries — when widespread screening for HCV was introduced with increasing levels of efficacy at detecting the virus. In low resource countries, blood safety remains an issue of major concern.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Birth to an infected mother is a less common mode of transmission. According to US Centers for Disease prevention and Control (CDC), approximately 6% of infants born to infected mothers will get Hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV infection can only be prevented by avoiding blood-to-blood contacts.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Preventative measures should also include getting tattoes and piercings in certified facilities that use sterile instruments. Healthcare workers should follow professional preventative guidelines.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HCV cannot usually be transmitted sexually. Nevertheless, even if sexual transmission is very uncommon, practices involving blood contact should be considered <em>at risk</em> behaviors. Having a sexually transmitted disease or HIV, having sex with multiple partners, or engaging in rough sex appears to increase a person’s risk of getting Hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Sharing razors and toothbrushes can expose an individual to infection as well.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Still, about 1 out of 4 patients does not know how or when he or she was infected.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a><sup><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"></a></sup></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">People who have recovered from acute hepatitis C and those who have been cured must be careful about prevention, since reinfection is possible.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is as yet, no proven vaccine for HCV.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">6.<strong><a name="sec6"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Why don’t we have a vaccine for HCV?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A vaccine contains a biological agent that is usually an attenuated or replication-deficient version of a disease causing organism. Exposure to this agent will safely stimulate an individual’s immune system to acquire an immunity to the microorganism without causing disease. HCV is a difficult virus to produce a vaccine for because of its genetic diversity. As such, it is a challenge for scientists to find a target on the virus that is common across HCV genotypes and subgenotypes.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In contrast, HBV is easily recognized by the protein called Antigen Australia (HBsAg), and an immunological response against HbsAg can stop the infection, but researchers have not yet found such a promising target in the structure of HCV.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The first vaccine for HCV to reach clinical trials was found to be safe and produced a good immune response in the 15 healthy human volunteers who took part in the phase 1 safety trial. Its efficacy is currently under investigation among intravenous drug users in two sites in the USA. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">7.<strong><a name="sec7"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">Can blood transfusions still transmit HCV today?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In developed countries<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a>, the first blood test for HCV was introduced in 1990. This test could detect antibodies against HCV proteins. In the USA, screening blood from donors with this HCV test decreased the risk of transfusion-associated HCV infection per unit of blood from 0.36% (1 in 274) to 0.07% (1 in 3300). Today it is estimated that this test has prevented transmission of HCV to 40,000 patients per year in the US. This test wasn’t perfect. Antibodies to HCV weren’t detectable in the blood for at least 12 weeks after infection, and sometimes more than 26 weeks. During this window, tainted blood could therefore appear safe.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A second-generation more sensitive test, able to detect infected blood as early as 10-20 days post infection, was developed and approved in 1992 . It is estimated that this new test prevented an additional 13,000 people from becoming infected with HCV each year.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/history-of-postransfusion-hep.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2058 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/history-of-postransfusion-hep.jpg" alt="history of postransfusion hep" width="567" height="454" /></a></span>Globally<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a>, blood transfusions are not yet as safe as they are in higher-income countries. Of 148 countries that provided WHO data for screening, 41 reported that they lacked the resources to screen all donated blood for one or more of the required transfusion-transmitted diseases (HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In sub-Saharan Africa, 28 out of the 40 countries have yet to implement national quality systems needed to assure effective screening of donated blood. WHO estimates that the lack of effective screening results in up to 5 million new infections of hepatitis C every year in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">8.<strong><a name="sec8"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are the challenges of HCV prevention in lower income countries?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The transmission of hepatitis C persists in most parts of Africa, as well as in other parts of the world, primarily because of traditional habits and a lack of resources in healthcare settings.</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h3Z8DuJnwWM?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> 9.<strong><a name="sec9"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are HCV genotypes, how many strains do we know and how common are they?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There are 7 main genotypes of Hepatitis C . These differences are based on major viral genetic characteristics, i.e. differences in the genetic sequence that may affect functional features of the virus and how it will respond to pharmacological treatments or antiviral drugs like interferon.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Other, more minor, variants can be found within each genotype; HCV is further classified into 67 confirmed and 20 provisional subtypes. The genetic differences between subtypes are more subtle, but these still need to be considered since these can sometimes influence the virus’s response to different kinds of treatments . In genotype 1, for example, the difference between genotype 1a and 1b is relevant in terms of anticipated treatment response and must therefore be assessed before initiating treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The high degree of genetic diversity of HCV continues to pose a significant challenge for achieving successful vaccines and drug therapies that are effective for all genotypes and subtypes, the so-called pan-genotypic treatment. Such an option would be of particularinterest in developing countries, where genotype testing is often unreliable or difficult to perform.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/most-common-genotypes.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2062 alignnone" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/most-common-genotypes-300x188.jpg" alt="most common genotypes" width="450" height="282" /></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some current treatments are said to be pan-genotypic, but in the real world they have different degrees of effectiveness for different genotypes and are not approved for all of them (<em>see</em> treatment module). Doses, length of treatment, and rate of success still partly depend on HCV genotype, and sometimes subtype. Alternative drugs with broader efficacy are currently under investigation.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is possible for a person to be infected with more than one genotype.</p>\r\n<p class="alignleft" style="text-align: justify;">Globally, the most common genotype is G1 (42% of all HCV cases), followed by G3 (26%) and G4 (17%). The most common subtype is 1b (27%).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Global distribution of different genotypes shows different prevalence in different areas of the world.</p>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence-map_genotypes.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2063 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prevalence-map_genotypes.jpg" alt="prevalence map_genotypes" width="950" height="404" /></a><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Map taken from Messina et al, 2014 (Fig 1A)</strong></span>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Genotype 1 (subtype 1b), is the most prevalent genotype in higher income countries, followed by genotype 3.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The global distribution of HCV genetic variation could be related to historical and contemporary trends in human migration. For example, strains from West Africa (genotype 2) could have been brought to the Americas through the trans-Atlantic slave trade.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One possible explanation for the global distribution of genotype 1 is its association with the most common cause of HCV infection in the 20th century — the distribution of contaminated blood and blood products before HCV screening of blood began. In fact, genotype 1 is prevalent in developed countries, where blood transfusions were more available and widespread: a hypothesis is that the most common sources of blood in those years were from areas where this genotype was prevalent.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The global dissemination of genotype 3 is more likely to be attributed to the association of subtype 3a with injection drug use and to population migration in United Kingdom during colonialism from countries where subtype 3a is dominant, such as India and Pakistan.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if genotype 1 and 3 infections are more prevalent than all other genotypes globally. Genotypes found more commonly in lower-income countries still account for a significant proportion of HCV cases worldwide. Specifically, genotype 2 is most frequent in West Africa and parts of South America (the latter likely reflecting population movements resulting from the trans-Atlantic slave trade), while genotypes 4 and 6 are common in Central/North Africa and East/Southeast Asia, respectively.</p>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/be-aware-box_1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2070 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/be-aware-box_1.jpg" alt="be aware box_1" width="1205" height="378" /></a>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">10.<strong><a name="sec10"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What are the symptoms of hepatitis C?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Most people with hepatitis C do not have symptoms and do not know they are infected until their liver has sustained significant damage.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A chronic viral hepatitis infection can present without any symptoms for decades.\r\nHowever, it is possible to experience the following symptoms:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>feeling unusually tired all the time</li>\r\n	<li>depression</li>\r\n	<li>jaundice</li>\r\n	<li>a general sense of feeling unwell</li>\r\n	<li>abdominal pain or bloating</li>\r\n	<li>loss of memory</li>\r\n	<li>itchy skin</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Since these symptoms are very vague, and similar to those reported in many other common diseases, people are often unaware of their condition until they develop cirrhosis, when scar tissue replaces healthy tissue in the liver and prevents the liver from working properly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The early stages of cirrhosis can be as insidious as the previous phases, with very few or no symptoms experienced by the individual, but as the liver loses its ability to function properly, a loss of appetite, nausea and itchy skin become more and more common.\r\nAs the disease progresses, and liver functions are affected, many new symptoms tend to develop:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">weight loss and muscle wasting</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">tenderness or pain around the liver area</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">blood capillaries on the skin above waist level</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">a tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequent nosebleeds or bleeding gums</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">hair loss</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">fever and shivering attacks</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">swelling in the legs, ankles and feet due to a build-up of fluid (edema)</li>\r\n	<li style="text-align: justify;">swelling in abdomen, due to a build-up of fluid known as ascites</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Changes in personality, insomnia, memory loss, confusion and difficulty concentrating are caused by an encephalopathy that can occur when toxins affect the brain, because the liver is unable to remove them from the body.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">11.<strong><a name="sec11"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How often does the disease progress into a chronic infection and what happens to the liver?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the WHO, at least 15% of infected persons spontaneously clear the virus within 6 months of infection, without any treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The remaining 55–85% of persons will develop a chronic HCV infection. When chronic Hepatitis C develops, it can result in long-term health problems, including liver damage, liver failure, liver cancer, and even death.\r\nOf those with chronic HCV infection, the risk of cirrhosis of the liver is 15–30% within 20 years.\r\nChronic hepatitis C is the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer and the most common reason for liver transplantation in the United States.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">For every 100 persons infected with HCV, approximately 1–5 will die from the consequences of chronic infection (liver cancer or cirrhosis) (source CDC).</p>\r\n<a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/z_liver-damage_timeline_1-flat-small.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2036 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/z_liver-damage_timeline_1-flat-small.jpg" alt="liver damage_timeline_final" width="2508" height="1751" /></a>\r\n\r\nbased on http://www.hepatitisc.uw.edu/go/evaluation-staging-monitoring/natural-history/core-concept/all\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCyoHQ-KKaw?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> 12.<strong><a name="sec12"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How can Hepatitis C be diagnosed?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In most cases infection is identified when the patient is screened for blood donation or when elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT, a liver enzyme) levels are detected during routine medical exams.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When HCV infection is suspected, a blood test is performed to search for antibodies against HCV. If the test detects the presence of antibodies, a second test is performed to directly establish whether the virus itself is currently present in the individual.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/org-chart_good-one2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2279 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/org-chart_good-one2.jpg" alt="org chart_good one2" width="907" height="2750" /></a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">...</p>\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9S1ycVi9gA?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C is based on the detection of both anti-HCV antibodies and direct detection of the HCV virus in the presence of biological (i.e. abnormal levels of liver enzymes in blood tests) or histological (that can be seen examining small parts of liver tissue taken by biopsy) signs of chronic hepatitis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Having anti-HCV antibodies (anti-HCV positive) in blood does not necessarily mean that an individual has an active hepatitis C infection. The presence of antibodies is an indication that a person has at some point in the past mounted an immune response againt HCV. Approximately 20% of the infected people clear the virus within 6 months, and these individuals will continue to carry antibodies againt HCV. Anti-HCV-positive, HCV RNA negative individuals should be retested for HCV RNA three months later to confirm true convalescence. After that, they are not considered to have hepatitis C. Although no longer infected, they will still test positive for anti-HCV antibodies all their lives. Since they don’t host the virus in their blood, they cannot spread the disease.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the presence of both anti-HCV antibodies and the HCV virus in blood indicates the presence of a hepatitis C infection and, consequently, that the person is infectious. If the direct HCV test is negative within 6 months, the patient had acute hepatitis C. If the test continues to yield positive results beyond 6 months, the patient is diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">After that time, it is very rare for the immune system to clear the virus and for the test to be negative.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, HCV antibodies are not protective against reinfection, which can occur after successful treatment as well (See <em>Treatment</em> module for more information).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2283 size-full" src="http://wfsj.org/hepatitis/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Table-2.jpg" alt="Table 2" width="2033" height="556" /></a>A laboratory test for identifying the genotype (and 1a/1b subtype) of the hepatitis C strain and an assessment of liver damage will guide treatment choices.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Establishing the amount of virus present, or the “viral load” can also help predict a treatment’s success.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A test of the patient’s DNA can help determine how effective certain drugs can be against HCV. Variants of a gene involved in the immune response against HCV (Interleukin 28B, IL28B), can alter the effect of certain HCV treatments (See Treatment module).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">13.<span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff;" name="sec13"></a>How can liver damage be assessed?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main factors influencing the type and timing of treatment is the severity of liver disease.\r\nPatients with cirrhosis have to be identified since their treatment regimen needs to be adapted accordingly. The fibrosis stage can be assessed initially with imaging (ultrasound scan, MRI,…), liver stiffness measurement, and identification of biomarkers in the blood.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Liver stiffness measurement (FibroScan®) measures how quickly vibrations pass through the liver. The more ‘stiff’ or damaged the liver is, the more quickly the waves will pass through it .</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Blood biomarkers include several direct markers which correlate with, or are part of, the liver matrix that is produced in the fibrosis process. Other indirect markers reflect changes in liver function. They are molecules released into the blood when there is inflammation of the liver.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Both stiffness measurement and biomarkers can distinguish quite well between cirrhosis and no-fibrosis. Combined, these tests can identify intermediate degrees of fibrosis. These tests reduce the need for an invasive liver biopsy, a procedure that can be problematic for patients with impaired blood clotting capacity.\r\nIn patients without compromised blood clotting, there is little risk of hemorrage from a liver biopsy, since it involves taking a small tissue sample from the liver though the skin by percutaneous core needle, under ultrasound guide. This tissue sample is then examined under a microscope.</p>\r\n14.<strong><a name="sec14"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How is Hepatitis C treated and managed?</span></strong>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When a diagnosis of Hepatitis C is confirmed, the presence or absence of other diseases must be established since this can influence prognosis and treatment. Mycotoxins, as well as alcohol, can make the evolution of the disease more severe. A concurrent infection with HIV, for example, can require a different approach with different drugs, and possible drug interactions must also be considered.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The degree of liver damage and virus genotype are used to drive treatment and management of the disease (see treatment module).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A therapy’s success is evaluated by blood tests showing no detectable virus. A sustained virus response (SVR), is the continued absence of detectable HCV virus in the blood six months (24 weeks) after the end of treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The antiviral Interferon-α was the the first drug treatment for HCV after it was discovered in 1989. In 2011, a more persistent form of interferon-α (Pegylated interferon- α), together with the antiviral drug ribavirin, increased the rates of success. These, however, never exceeded a 50% cure rate, and their heavy side effects often forced patients to discontinue the treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2011, new antivirals called Direct Agent Antivirals (DAA, i.e. protease inhibitors acting directly on the virus instead of on the patient) were introduced, to be given in association with previous drugs (triple therapy regimen). They improved the SVR in up to 75% of patients, but with even worse side effects.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All these therapies were more effective on other genotypes than on genotype 1, the most common in higher income countries. Substantial research efforts led to a new class of DAA. The first to be introduced was sofosbuvir in 2014. The new therapies are even more effective on genotype 1 than on others, approaching 95% of success rates in clinical trials with fewer and milder side effects.\r\nNow, the real challenge is providing access to these revolutionary drugs (please refer to Treatment section for success rates of the DAA in other genotypes). They are very expensive and on a global scale most healthcare systems and patients cannot afford them.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This has made hepatitis C therapy more a policy issue than a medical one.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9S1ycVi9gA?rel=0" width="604" height="341" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>REFERENCES</strong>\r\n\r\nPrati, D.
